What is Dexmedetomidine?,"Dexmedetomidine is an alpha-2 agonist that acts centrally as a sedating agent with minimal effect on respiratory status. Similar to clonidine, dexmedetomidine can produce a variety of hemodynamic responses including bradycardia, hypotension and hypertension. Dexmedetomidine is administered by continuous infusion. It is ultra-short acting and the effects (including sedation) will rapidly resolve if the infusion is discontinued. Dexmedetomidine may be used for sedation or anxiolysis in patients without an artificial airway, or as an adjunct to other sedating agents for patients with an artificial airway.","• Dexmedetomidine is used to provide sedation for critically ill patients when traditional agents are not adequate or in an attempt to spare use of benzodiazepines • Dexmedetomidine and clonidine are alpha 2 adrenergic agonist agents. Both display a high specificity for the α receptor over the α receptor; however, Dexmedetomidine exerts a specificity of 1600:1 for α : α 2 1 2 1 receptor, whereas the specificity of clonidine is 200:1. For this reason, there are no direct conversions of Dexmedetomidine to clonidine. There are, however, recommended clonidine doses. Inclusion Criteria: • Need for sedation including short term peri-extubation sedation (consider in place of benzodiazepines when applicable) • Anticipate < 14 days of sedation Not recommended due to minimal data: • < 35 weeks post menstrual age • Potential need for ECMO • Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy requiring therapeutic hypothermia Contraindications • Uncontrolled hypotension • Sustained bradycardia (heart rate < 80) • Hepatic failure","This category includes diseases or clinical states in which the use of dexmedetomidine may be indicated, but only after careful consideration of the risks involved and other viable options: 1.

Symptoms of opiate withdrawal appear to be due to increased noradrenergic neuronal activity in the locus ceruleus which is regulated both by alpha-2 adrenergic and opiate receptors. Clonidine appears to exert specific effects through non-opiate alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. Important points: • Clonidine can NOT be abruptly stopped • Routes of administrations: ◦ Transdermal patch: preferred route; available as 100mCg/ patch. Transdermal clonidine patches MAY BE CUT to achieve a smaller dose in the ICU areas and under certain circumstances on the floor. Nursing staff cut the patch into ¼ or ½ fractions based on dose needed. ◦ Enteral: should be used if patch not adhering due to diaphoresis; or when bridging to patch is indicated ◦ Intravenous: should be used only if enteral or transdermal routes are not an option; or when bridging to patch is indicated and patient is NPO 4 Routinely opioid and benzodiazepine continuous infusions should not be converted to intermittent IV dosing when patient NPO due to increased number of times accessing line.

What is ECMO,"1. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is the application of a modified cardiopulmonary bypass circuit designed for extended duration use in patients with cardiac and/or respiratory failure who do not respond to conventional measures or treatments. 2. This guideline broadly describes the application of ECMO to patients with primary cardiac failure, primary respiratory failure, or a combination of both. 3. The clinical management of patients requiring ECMO support is administered by a multidisciplinary team. The technical aspects of ECMO are managed by specially trained Registered Respiratory Therapists (RRTs) referred to as ECMO Specialists. 4. A number of ECMO circuits and systems are available to support patients of all age groups. ECMO is either applied electively or urgently. When instituted in the setting of cardiac arrest, it is referred to as extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation or ECPR. 5. ECMO is primarily initiated in the CICU or the MSICU, but may be initiated in the OR and Cardiac Catheterization Lab, and in rare circumstances, initiation in the Emergency Department, NICU or MICU may be needed for moribund patients who are too unstable to transfer. 6. Avoid ECPR deployment in clinical or diagnostic areas that do not have the appropriately trained personnel, supplies, and infrastructure to initiate ECMO (e.g. Radiology, Emergency Department). Instead, patients who are candidates for ECMO should be rapidly transferred to the CICU or MSICU for treatment.","Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is the application of a modified cardiopulmonary bypass circuit designed for extended duration use in patients with cardiac and/or respiratory failure who do not respond to conventional measures or treatments.

An Attending Physician in consultation with an Attending Surgeon notifies the Charge RN of the decision to initiate ECMO. 2. The Charge RN notifies the ECMO Specialist by paging E-C-M-O (3266) , and conveying the patient's weight, diagnosis, and location of cannulation. The ECMO Specialist brings the ECMO system and cannula cart. 3. The Charge RN facilitates the notification of a surgical team, and requests an ""ECMO Pack"" from the Blood bank. 4. Refer to unit-specific processes for ECMO notification. Patient Selection General Indications ECMO is considered in the following situations: ◦ Cardiac arrest in which the cause of arrest is unclear and the underlying condition warrants further evaluation. ◦ Low cardiac output syndrome despite maximal hemodynamic support. ◦ Severe sepsis. ◦ Support for high-risk procedures. ◦ Newborns with hypoxemic respiratory failure (e.g. PPHN) with a sustained oxygenation index (OI) ≥ 40 with CMV, or ≥ 60 with maximum treatment including HFOV ± iNO. ◦ Pediatric respiratory failure. ◦ Cardiorespiratory failure of unclear etiology. ◦ Worsening or persistent pulmonary air leaks refractory to air-leak ventilator strategies and other interventions. ◦ Inadequate gas exchange despite optimized HFOV or other advance ventilator modalities and strategies. ◦ Congenital diaphragmatic hernia. ◦ Bridge to lung transplantation. ◦ Bridge to heart transplantation or other form of mechanical circulatory support. ◦ Toxic Ingestion ◦ Hypothermia Relative Contraindications ◦ Weight < 1.5 kg due to cannula size limitations (Except for thoracic cannulations). ◦ Gestational age < 34 weeks due to the increased risk of IVH because of the need for anticoagulation ◦ Existing large intracranial hemorrhage ◦ Fatal chromosomal abnormality ◦ Continuous CPR for 1 hour prior to the availability of ECMO (e.g. unwitnessed out-of-house cardiopulmonary arrest) ◦ Severe coagulopathy, high risk for or active bleeding. Modes of ECMO Support General Description Mode Drainage Re-infusion Veno-arterial (VA) Venous Arterial Veno-venous-arterial (VVA) Venous-Venous Arterial Veno-venous (VV) Venous Venous Veno-venous Venous (VVV) Venous-Venous Venous Venous-venous Dual-lumen (VVDL) Venous Venous-venous Bi-caval Dual-lumen Venous (VV Bi-caval) Venous-Arterial ◦ Venous-arterial (VA) ECMO provides cardiac and pulmonary support. Blood is drained from the right- side of the heart and re-infused into the arterial circulation. ◦ Drainage is established by cannulation of the right atrium, cannulation of a femoral vein, or cannulation of the right internal jugular vein. Re-infusion is established by cannulation of the aortic arch, cannulation of a femoral artery, or cannulation of the right common carotid artery. ◦ Drainage of the left atrium may be enhanced with the addition of an LA-vent (VA+LA-vent) to the drainage limb, which aids in decompressing a failing left ventricle. Decompression of the left atrium may also be accomplished by performing a balloon atrial septostomy. ◦ Some larger patients may require two drainage cannulae such as both femoral veins, or one femoral vein and one internal jugular vein (e.g. VV-A). Venous-Venous ◦ Venous-venous (VV) ECMO provides pulmonary support. Blood is drained from, and re-infused to, the right-side of the heart. ◦ Specially designed double-lumen cannulas (VVDL) provide drainage and re-infusion, and are placed into the right internal jugular vein. ◦ In larger patients venous drainage is usually from a femoral vein and re-infusion through the right internal jugular vein, and in larger patients two femoral venous cannulae may be needed for optimal drainage (VV-V). ◦ VV-B-caval cannulas are used for anticipated long-term ECMO (e.g. bridge to lung transplant), and are inserted with the aid of fluoroscopy, generally in the cardiac catheterization lab or OR. Circuit Preparation and Cannulation Circuit Preparation Elective ECMO ◦ An ECMO Specialist prepares and maintains ECMO circuits. ◦ Circuit preparation consists of a step-wise priming procedure, with the final step being the addition of blood products. Once blood products are added and treated, the crystalloid solution is displaced, and an ECMO circuit panel is measured. ◦ The lab results are designated as a ""Circuit Panel"", indicating the results are from the circuit prior to patient interaction. Circuit Panel Targets pH 7.35 - 7.45 K + < 8 mEq/L PCO 35-45 mmHg Ionized Ca ++ > 0.8 mEq/L 2 PO > 300 mmHg Na + > 125 mEq/L 2 HCO - 22-24 mEq/L 3 ECPR ◦ Two readily deployable circuits are available for ECPR; a neonatal circuit for patients < 8 kg, and a pediatric circuit for patients >8 kg. The circuits are rapidly primed with PlasmaLyte-A, albumin, and heparin. Cannulae Selection Cannulae selection is determined by: ◦ Route: Groin, neck, or chest ◦ Surgical Technique: Cut-down or percutaneous ◦ Type of ECMO support: VV, VVDL, VVV, VVA, or VA ◦ Refer to ECMO Reference Tools . Pre-cannulation Considerations 1. The ICU Attending Physician, Fellow, or Nursing confirms: a. Clot present in blood bank b. Neurologic assessment (HUS for neonates) c. Venous and arterial access d. Plan for sedation and analgesia e. Review of outside ECHO (if available). 5. Nursing obtains: a. CBC b. Clot c. PT, PTT, Fibrinogen d. Electrolytes 6. Position patient for cannulation; infants are best positioned with head at the foot of the bed for neck cannulations. 7. Prepare medications: a. Routine resuscitation medications b. Heparin bolus of 75 units/kg c. Heparin 100 units/mL in D10W or D5W (total 50mL) for continuous infusion d. Hydralazine 0.1 mg/kg/dose IV e. 5% albumin f. Normal saline for fluid resuscitation g. Amicar if indicated h. Sedation and analgesia as ordered by the ICU Fellow or Nurse Practitioner i. Paralytic agent as ordered by the ICU Fellow or Nurse Practitioner Cannulation 1. A surgical team performs the cannulation procedure, and conducts a procedure ""time-out"" prior to incision. Refer to ECMO Time Out . 8. The ICU Team monitors and manages hemodynamics, airway, ventilatory support, and ensures sedation and analgesia during the cannulation procedure. 9. At the direction and discretion of the cannulating surgeon, the patient may receive a bolus of 75 units/kg of heparin prior to placement of cannulae. 10. Once cannulae have been secured, the ECMO circuit drainage and re-infusion lines are passed to the surgeon in a sterile manner and cut away from the ECMO priming reservoir. 11. The drainage, or venous line, is indicated with a blue marker and the re-infusion, or arterial line, with a red marker. Once a second time out is performed, and the surgeon verifies air-free connections, and the ECMO Specialist verifies that the lines are connected properly, the line clamps are removed and the ECMO pump is started. Immediate Post-Cannulation Period Elective ECMO ◦ Target ECMO flow rate of 100 – 200 mL/kg/min. ◦ When possible, quickly wean vasoactive drugs. ◦ If there is decreased venous return, administer volume, assess cannula position, and increase height of the bed. ◦ Assess the degree of recirculation with VVDL ECMO. This can be managed by placing a roll under the patient's shoulders, manipulating ECMO flow rates, or confirming cannula position. ◦ The Surgeon dresses the cannula site and maintains a sterile field until Attending Surgeon, or designee, confirms cannula position by CXR. ◦ Once flow has been established, administer platelets and cryoprecipitate. ◦ The ECMO Specialist monitors membrane and drainage, pressures, flow rate, and sweep gas. ◦ Measure an ABG, electrolytes, and ionized calcium once the patient is stable. ◦ Measure a hematocrit, platelet count, PT, Fibrinogen, AT-III, and unfractionated heparin level once all the blood products are given (approximately 2 hours after cannulation). ECPR ◦ As soon as the blood pack arrives, PRBCs, FFP, platelets, and cryoprecipitate, are administered and hemofiltration established in order to achieve normal fluid balance and hemoconcentration. ◦ Verify cannula placement via a CXR. Echocardiography may also be used to assess cannulae position, volume status of the patient, and the degree of decompression of the RA and LA. Blood Components Blood Products for Cannulation Once the decision has been made to use ECMO, notify the Blood Bank and request an ECMO Blood Pack which consists of PRBC: 2 units, FFP: 1 unit, Cryoprecipitate: 1 unit, and Platelets: 2 units. Blood Product Administration Packed red blood cells (PRBC) ◦ 20 mL/kg for a HCT < 30%, or specific target per ICU team Platelets ◦ Transfuse at least 2 units of platelets for platelet count is < 80,000 µ/L, or specific target per ICU team. Cryoprecipitate ◦ Transfuse at least 2 units for fibrinogen < 100 mg/dL or specific target per ICU team. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) ◦ Administer 10 mL/kg if the PT is ≥ 17 seconds. 5% Albumin ◦ Crystalloid may be used for volume expansion such as acute decrease in venous return. The use of 5% albumin as a volume expander should be reserved for patients with low albumin levels. For more information, please refer to the Patient Care Manual: Transfusion of Blood Products and PCM>ECMO & Mechanical Circulatory Support: Anticoagulation Management Protocol. General ECMO Management Blood Gas Monitoring Obtain: ◦ Pre- and post membrane blood gases when acute and unexpected changes in gas exchange occur and membrane function is in question. ◦ Arterial blood gases following cannulation and repeat until adjustments in flow rate and sweep gas achieve clinically acceptable results. ◦ Routine arterial blood gases a minimum of every 12 hours and every time a change in sweep gas is made. ◦ A mixed venous saturation a minimum of every 24 hours for calibration of the ECMO mixed venous saturation monitor or if there is a question about adequate ECMO flow on VA ECMO. Hemodynamic Monitoring and Blood Pressure Control Neonates ◦ Neonates requiring ECMO support are at significant risk for intracranial hemorrhage due to pre- existing hypoxemia/hypotension, anti-coagulation, venous occlusion, or carotid artery ligation. ◦ Mean arterial pressure is generally maintained at age specific norms (Neonates 45-50 mmHg; Children/Adults 50-70 mmHg), and changes in MAP to > 70 mmHg or < 30 mmHg may require immediate action. ◦ Initial actions include ruling-out any mechanical problems associated with ECMO, such as, inadvertent hemofiltration, or changes in ECMO flow. ◦ Acute and sustained hypotension may be corrected with volume replacement, by increasing vasoactive medications, or by increasing the ECMO flow (if able). ◦ Acute and sustained hypertension may be managed by assessing the need for additional sedation or analgesia, and administering hydralazine at 0.1 mg/kg/dose (usual max 0.5 mg/kg). Pediatric-Adult ◦ A clinically acceptable mean arterial pressure range is established by the care team; ECMO flows and vasoactive agents are titrated accordingly. ◦ Rule out mechanical problems associated with ECMO, such as inadvertent hemofiltration, or changes in ECMO flow, when acute changes in blood pressure occur. ◦ Correct acute and sustained hypotension with volume replacement, by increasing vasoactive medications, or by increasing the ECMO flow (if able). ◦ Manage acute and sustained hypertension by assessing the need for additional sedation or analgesia, administering antihypertensives, or reducing the ECMO flow. Temperature Regulation ◦ Maintain patient temperature per target prescribed by ICU team by making adjustments in the water pump temperature. ◦ Following ECPR, consider decreasing body temperature to 33-35°C for neuro-protection; follow established hypothermia guidelines. Laboratory Studies and Cultures ◦ CBC, platelets, coags, AT-III, and unfractionated heparin level every 6 hours for the first 24 hours. After that, CBC, platelets, and coags are done every 12 hours. However, AT-III and unfractionated heparin level remain at every 6 hours. ◦ The rest of the lab plan is per ICU team. ◦ For more information, refer to PCM>ECMO and Mechanical Circulatory Support: Anticoagulation Management Protocol . Analgesia and Sedation Cannulation ◦ The ICU fellow provides sedation during the cannulation procedure. Choice of agents is patient and situation specific, but generally includes an opioid, a benzodiazepine, and a muscle relaxant. ◦ Doses of fentanyl required to achieve comfort and avoid hypertension during surgical dissection of the neck are higher than those typically used for sedation. Titrated doses up to 25 mcg/kg are reasonable. ECMO Course ◦ Following cannulation in the ICU team will establish a sedation plan. ◦ Use of fentanyl for ongoing analgesia following cannulation is not recommended due to absorption by the ECMO membrane. ◦ The uses of volatile anesthetic agents or lipid based infusions are not recommended with the use of microporous ECMO membranes. Volatile anesthetic agents may be administered through the usual intrapulmonary route. Muscle Relaxants ◦ Consider the use of muscle relaxants when evaluating decannulation readiness, when patient movement interferes with achieving target ECMO flow rates or potentially compromises the security of the cannula sutures ◦ If muscle relaxants are being used, consider daily wake-up tests in order to perform neurologic exams. Antibiotics ◦ The ICU team will prescribe appropriate antibiotic coverage. Neurologic Evaluation ◦ Consult the Neurologic ICU team following cannulation. Neurology provides daily assessments. Neonates ◦ Obtain a head ultrasound within 24 hours following cannulation and every 48 hours thereafter, unless there are abnormal findings, in which case a daily HUS is obtained. ◦ An additional HUS may be warranted for acute and frequent BP instability. Pediatric-Adult ◦ Periodically hold muscle relaxants and, if needed, perform a sedation holiday in order for an exam by a neurologist to be conducted. ◦ The multidisciplinary team collaboratively makes the decision to pursue diagnostic imaging (e.g. portable head CT), weighing risk and benefits of patient. Skin Care Refer to: Pressure Ulcer Risk Assessment and Prevention . ECMO Cannula Site/Dressing Change Neonates ◦ Place a gel pad, or small Z-Flo pillow, under occiput. ◦ Provide appropriate boundaries and prevent hip abduction by ""nesting"" the patient. Initiate bilateral patient rotation. ◦ Keeping the patient's head midline, list side to side, every two hours, to slightly redistribute pressure points. Pediatric-Adult ◦ Some specialty beds do not provide a pressure relieving surface. Meticulous skin care is needed to prevent skin breakdown. List patient side to side Q2 as tolerated. Maintain heels off bed. ◦ Post femoral cannulation: maintain proper body alignment as tolerated with ECMO flow to prevent peripheral neuropathy. ◦ Perform Braden Q score everyday. Once patient is stable, if possible, turn patient side to side once a day to examine back and buttocks for breakdown. ◦ Do not leave CPR boards or other hard objects under patient. ◦ For more information, see the Patient Care Manual: Pressure Ulcer Risk Assessment and Prevention . Nutritional Support ◦ Enteral nutrition can be safely administered during ECMO. Trophic feeds are recommended early during the ECMO course to maintain gut integrity and health. Feeds may then be advanced as per ICU protocol. ◦ Consult with Nutrition Support Service for PN if unable to feed enterally. TPN may be administered via the ECMO circuit. ◦ Lipids are administered directly to the patient via a peripheral IV. Lipids do not exceed > 3 g/kg/day to prevent lipid accumulation and embolism in the circuit. Fluid Management D10W or D20W ◦ Excluding blood products, generally give 80-100 mL/kg/day of volume including PN and intralipids. Diuretics ◦ Immediately after cannulation, most patients require volume expansion due to systemic inflammatory response and capillary leak. ◦ Once the patient's need for fluid resuscitation has improved, and hemodynamics are adequate, diuresis is indicated to improve chest wall and lung compliance. Most patients respond well to loop diuretics (e.g. lasix). Hemofiltration ◦ All ECMO circuits have the ability to be equipped with a hemofilter. ◦ Hemofiltration is typically used to exchange the volume of blood products following a clear prime cannulation. The goal is to be able to remove the amount of fluid that was given in blood products. ◦ Hemofiltration may not be possible if the patient is persistently hypotensive, if there are problems with venous return, or if the patient is hypovolemic. ◦ The ICU Team establishes a daily plan specifying the amount of fluid to be removed by hemofiltration. Examples include: ▪ Volume of blood products only, ▪ Achieving a certain negative fluid balance in a 24-hour period, ▪ A fixed amount each hour, or ▪ No hemofiltration if the patient's native urine output falls below a certain amount. Ventilator Management ◦ When a patient is placed on ECMO due to respiratory failure, the patient should be placed on ""resting vent settings"". The lung protective settings will be determined by the ICU team. ◦ If a patient has air leak, consider eliminating phasic ventilation and using CPAP. ◦ In the CICU, where the lungs are usually healthy, vent settings should be set to achieve normal tidal volumes and preserve FRC. ◦ Artificial airway suctioning is done as clinically needed and per ICU standards. Anticoagulation ◦ Anticoagulation is achieved with a continuous infusion of heparin. Refer to Anticoagulation Management Protocol for more information. Anti-Fibrinolytic Therapy ◦ Consider antifibrinolytic therapy such as aminocaproic acid (Amicar) or tranexamic (TXA) in the management of bleeding. ◦ General indications for Amicar include ▪ Prematurity (e.g. < 37 weeks gestational age) ▪ Following repair of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (x 72 hours) ▪ Post-operative or post-procedure bleeding ▪ Patients with a pre-existing IVH ▪ Severely hypoxic and/or acidotic patients (pH ≤ 7.10 at the time of cannulation) ▪ Patients who receive CPR prior to cannulation ◦ Additional considerations ▪ When using antifibrinolytics for ongoing bleeding, consider an additional loading dose following ECMO circuit changes. ▪ Continue antifibrinolytic therapy throughout the ECMO course for patients with pre-existing IVH. ▪ Antifibrinolytic therapy for postoperative bleeding may be discontinued after 72 hours, if coagulation management is stable and there is no evidence of active bleeding. ▪ Do not infuse antifibrinolytics in the same line as PN. ECMO Circuit Surveillance ◦ ECMO Specialists conduct periodic circuit surveillance and safety checks, and notify the team of potential circuit issues such as thrombus, and when component or circuit replacement is warranted. ◦ ECMO Specialists notify the care team when planned and unplanned troubleshooting sequences are needed. At a minimum the bedside RN, Charge RN, and ICU Fellow are present to monitor the patient during ECMO circuit repairs. ◦ Refer to ECMO System Assessments and Handoffs , Replacing an ECMO Circuit and ECMO Emergencies . Weaning and De-Cannulation Evaluating Readiness for De-cannulation ◦ Recovery of cardiac function. May consider obtaining an ECHO while clamped ◦ Improved lung compliance and resolving alveolar densities on CXR ◦ Cardiovascular stability and adequate renal function ◦ An ICU Fellow is present at the bedside, just prior to, and immediately following separation from ECMO ◦ Closely monitor hemodynamics; titrate vasoactive agents and give volume as needed ◦ Evaluate proper analgesia, sedation, and muscle relaxation ◦ In the MSICU, Refer to Guidelines for Evaluating De-cannulation Readiness in Newborns with CDH and Evaluating De-cannulation Readiness in Newborns with HRF . De-cannulation De-cannulation is a surgical procedure and is coordinated by an Attending Surgeon. An OR team assembles. 12. An ICU Fellow monitors the patient's hemodynamics and ensures anesthesia and analgesia. 13. Maintain the ECMO circuits until surgical drapes are removed and the dressing is placed. 14. The RN prepares sedation, analgesia, muscle relaxants, vasoactive drugs and volume as deemed necessary by the ICU Attending or Fellow.",

New England Donor Services (NEDS) is the OPO used at Boston Children's Hospital. b. New England Donor Services (NEDS) 24 Hour Number: 1-800-446-6362 2. A patient's death is "" imminent "" when: a. A patient is mechanically ventilated in an intensive care unit or the emergency department AND b. A patient's attending physician has decided that death by neurologic criteria (DNC, i.e., brain death) testing will be performed, OR c. A patient's attending physician and family have agreed that life-sustaining treatments will be withdrawn. 3. Notification of the OPO must be "" timely "": a. For ""imminent"" deaths (mechanically-ventilated patients): i. As soon as possible after the attending physician's decision to perform death by neurologic criteria (DNC, i.e., brain death) testing, OR ii. As soon as possible after the patient's attending physician and family agree that life-sustaining treatments will be withdrawn AND , in all cases when feasible, before life-sustaining treatments are withdrawn. b. For all patients who have died anywhere in the hospital: i. As soon as possible (ideally, within 1 hour) after death is declared. 4. The organ procurement organization (OPO) is solely responsible for determining medical suitability for organ, tissue, and eye donation, not the medical team. a. The OPO must be called for every planned withdrawal of support, death by neurologic criteria (DNC, i.e., brain death) evaluation, and death in the hospital regardless of the underlying condition of the patient or their likely candidacy for organ donation. 5. The individual designated by the hospital to inform potential donor families of the option for donation and request organ donation is an OPO representative. Ideally, the OPO and the hospital medical team collaborate to decide how and by whom the family will be approached. 6. The attending physician or designated representative is responsible for informing the family of the patient's death, either cardiac death or death by neurologic criteria (DNC, i.e., brain death). Record of death (date and time) is documented in the patient's record. 7. The OPO and the hospital Organ Donation Council work together to provide periodic education on donation issues to appropriate staff. 8. OPO staff conducts regular chart reviews of deceased patients to assess adherence to organ and tissue donation policy and procedure and improve identification of potential donors. The OPO provides report of compliance to designated hospital administration on a regular basis.","An anatomical gift of a donor's body or part may be made during the life of the donor for the purpose of transplantation, therapy, research or education by: 1.

You cannot speak directly to the patient. The patient should have a designated person to give their health history and sign a release form for permission. How much information given to the designated person, i.e. date, time and type of procedure, should be done on a case by case basis ◦ At the time of chart review, send an email to ""securitymanagment_dl"" to notify them of the incarcerated and/or shackles patient with the date of surgery, name and MR number; ie ""please be aware John Doe will be having Day surgery on 1/2/22. He is in DYS custody and will be arriving in shackles and handcuffs accompanied by two staff members from the facility"". • It is expected that the DYS or DSS, will contact security with an arrival time, and then check in with Security upon their arrival. • Efforts will be made to bring these patients into the hospital and get them to their appointments as discretely as possible. Security will provide a wheelchair and a blanket, the patient will be placed in the wheelchair, and the blanket used to cover the shackles (i.e. at the patients hands and legs). Security will then escort the party to the appointment ◦ The Pavilion employee entrance may be used to gain access to the facility as these appointments are often in the Fegan building ◦ If going to the Fegan, the party should be escorted to the Fegan elevators via the basement and an elevated should be taken out of service for only as long as it takes to reach the party's destination. ◦ Once at the clinic, unit, etc. the escorting Security officer should check with the registration desk, charge nurse , etc. to ensure that they are aware of the patients arrival and condition ◦ When the appointment is finished, staff should call x 56121, and inform security of the impending departure. Once the appointment is done security will escort the patient out of the hospital in the same fashion as described above. • Guidelines for care of the DYS patient in shackles: Patients in residential (department of youth services) DYS custody are referred to BCH for emergency care and admission if needed. The dignity of the patient is preserved at all times • DYS Staff Responsibility ◦ Two DYS staff accompanies the patient and remains with patient at all times. ◦ Upon arrival to the ED or inpatient unit, the RN discusses specific needs of the patient with the DYS worker. The DYS worker determines if hospital security is needed. ◦ If for any reason the handcuffs or shackles are removed for clinical interventions, the DYS worker remains in the room. The DYS worker is respectful of privacy and will turn away from the patient while intervention is being performed. • Patient communications ◦ DYS patients are not allowed to make phone calls. The DYS worker is responsible for making sure the patient doesn't have a cell phone. ◦ Follow up appointments should not be discussed with the patient but rather given to the DYS worker. ◦ BCH legal does not need to be contacted for notification that a patient is here in shackles unless there is need for legal guidance • Nursing Responsibility ◦ The RN discusses the best approach to meeting ADL needs of the patient with the DYS worker. ◦ The RN assesses for signs of skin breakdown and performs all other care as indicated and documents according to policy.","Once a formal family meeting is deemed appropriate, the NICU team will hold the first comprehensive family meetings during the first week of admission and at least once/month, or more often if warranted. To ensure effective communication during family meetings: • Assess parental knowledge and understanding of reason for admission to the NICU, their infant's current condition, and unit procedures for transfer and discharge • Present a unified message from the health care team to the family • Refer to the infant by first name when possible • Address the family's most urgent questions and concerns at the beginning of the meeting • Assess parents' information preferences and support needs • Listen carefully to the nature of parents' questions and comments to help them formulate additional questions • Recognize the delicate balance between informing and overwhelming • Reassure parents that information can be repeated until it is fully understood • Emphasize the importance of parent advocacy • Summarize information at the end of the family meeting and establish a timeline for the next discussion • Provide written notes documenting discussion to the family at the end of the meeting if possible • Schedule regular family meetings to review progress and outline next steps • Provide a point person to coordinate communication particularly when multiple consultants and disciplines are involved. Other practices that may be helpful include: Educational material for the parents, encouragement of early and frequent involvement of social worker psychologist/psychiatrist as needed, and providing supportive resources for the parents.

Can private health data be shared,"The purpose of this guidance is to inform researchers on how to respond to individual (de-identified) participant-level research data sharing conditional mandates from publications, funding agencies, and consortiums. This guidance focuses on data sharing requirements for individual participant level data regardless of funding. Individual participant level data is raw data from individual participants. It includes demographic information for each participant such as age, sex, nature of their health condition, as well as information about evaluations/treatments or tests received as part of the research and the outcomes observed. NIH has very specific requirements and associated timing. This information is included at the end of the document. • Data sharing must balance the data sharing requirements with privacy and human subject considerations for each protocol on a case-by-case basis. • Investigators need to plan for data sharing as part of the initial IRB review process and include this possibility in the informed consent, as appropriate. • Investigators should take into consideration any expectations of funding agencies and journals requirements before beginning the research. Increasingly journals and funding agencies have an expectation of placing individual participant level data into repositories when the research is completed. • The protocol and consent form should address the sharing of summary, aggregate or statistical analyses, as well as individual participant-level research data. • Investigators working on research covered by the NIH Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy must obtain participants' consent for their genomic and phenotypic data to be used for future research purposes and to be shared broadly. This also includes specimens used to generate a cell lines as well. ◦ The IRB template consent form contains language which meets the requirement of the GDS policy. • IRB review will not be necessary for sharing of methods, protocol-related documents, summary, aggregate or statistical analyses.","Non-public BCH Research Data should never be shared outside of BCH without an agreement . Agreements protect your work, the subject's privacy, and the Institution. Agreements for commercial, sensitive, or proprietary Data must be reviewed by the Office of General Counsel and signed by the Authorized Signatory. The reviewing office will communicate who the signatory should be. • Agreements to purchase or store data are reviewed and approved by the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) ; • Material Transfer Agreements (transfers of biological materials e.g., mouse lines, antibodies and other research tools) are facilitated by the Technology and Innovation Development Office (TIDO) ; • Agreements for Clinical Trials, data use (human subject data and limited data sets as defined in HIPAA; Confidential Data) or third-party vendors who handle data should be reviewed by the Clinical Trials Business Office (CTBO) . • Agreements containing data security or data management requirements will be reviewed by Research Computing and Information Security through the SDR process provided the agreement has been reviewed and approved by one of the offices above.","• Individuals with access to confidential information may only access it on a ""need to know"" basis. • Examples of confidential information include but are not limited to: ◦ Patient medical, social, financial and demographic information. ◦ Employee health information, employee data subject to privacy restrictions and any other employee or personnel information subject to privacy or confidentiality protections under state or federal laws or regulations. ◦ Hospital business information, such as financial and payor information, strategic planning, fundraising and reporting information and internal memoranda. ◦ Research information, including information describing or relating to inventions and discoveries. ◦ Information concerning outside companies, with which the hospital does business, including information the Hospital is contractually obligated to keep confidential. ◦ Employee or personnel information which is confidential and protected from disclosure by law, including information covered by peer review privilege or attorney-client privilege. • When accessing confidential information for purposes of performing your job, individuals must: ◦ Not disclose, release, distribute, or discuss this confidential information unless it is administratively or clinically necessary and you have been authorized to do so. ◦ Access or use confidential information only as required to perform their job. ◦ Provide the minimum information necessary when responding to information requests made by others for purposes of performing their jobs. Not use any electronic media to copy and/or transmit confidential information unless specifically authorized to do so. • Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Policy shall prohibit an employee from accessing or discussing their own employee health information, employee data, or personnel information. Nothing in this policy is intended to interfere with an employee's rights to discuss his or her wages, hours and working conditions, or otherwise exercise his or her rights to engage in protected concerted activity under law.","An example of consent language that may be considered is as follows: In order to allow researchers to share results, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other central repositories have developed special data (information) ""banks"" that collect the results and analyze data from genetic studies. These central banks may also analyze, and store samples and health information form research conducted by Boston Children's Hospital. These central banks will store your genetic and health information and/or samples and give them to other qualified and approved researchers to do more studies on diseases related to your condition and many other types of diseases or conditions. We do not think that there will be further risks to your privacy and confidentiality by sharing your health information, samples and/or genetic information with these banks. However, we cannot predict how genetic information will be used in the future. The samples and data will be sent with only your study code number attached. Your name or other directly identifiable information will not be given to these central banks. There are many safeguards in place to protect your privacy.","If Principal Investigators (PIs) need specific language for a data sharing plan, the following should be considered and customized: We are committed to making resources and data from the proposed research available to other investigators in the research community. All data collected for this research will be obtained with IRB review/approval and a waiver of consent/informed consent of study participants to sharing of de-identified data. We will submit (insert type of data to be shared as well as relevant associated data for example phenotype and exposure data) to XXX data repository in a timely manner, as indicated by the XXX policy; we acknowledge the registry will have (insert restricted /unrestricted access). We will also submit any information reasonably necessary to interpret the data, such as study protocols, data instruments and survey tools. The identities of research participants will not be disclosed to the repository. We will take appropriate steps to de-identify datasets according to the HIPAA privacy law .

Are cats better than dogs,"ARCH: Animal Resources at Children's Hospital AWAR: Animal Welfare Act Regulations IACUC: Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee USDA: United States Department of Agriculture USDA-covered species : Any species covered by the Animal Welfare Act Regulations (AWAR), i.e., ""dog, cat, nonhuman primate, guinea pig, hamster, rabbit, or any other warm-blooded animal, which is being used, or is intended for research, teaching, testing, experimentation…."" Specifically excluded from the AWAR are ""birds, rats of the genus Rattus and mice of the genus Mus bred for use in research."" By definition this also excludes cold-blooded animals such as fish and frogs. Classification of Procedures 1. Procedure : Any manipulation of an animal for an experimental application, for examination purposes or for the treatment of an induced or spontaneous disease or condition. To differentiate from ""surgical procedures"", ""procedures"" include injection, bandaging or casting, radiography, imaging (MRI, PET, etc.), non-invasive monitoring, antibody production, phlebotomy, euthanasia, etc. Procedures may or may not require the use of a sedative or anesthetic. 2. Surgery : Usually involves an incision and exposure of a tissue for an operative method or the operative manipulation of physiologic or physical parameters to create a model of a clinical disease process or condition and/or the treatment of such disease or condition. Surgery usually requires anesthesia and is further classified as major or minor, survival or acute (non-survival). Survival surgery involving USDA- covered species must be performed in ARCH, and cannot be performed in research laboratories, or by off -site contract or collaborating facilities, unless an exception to this policy is specifically granted by the IACUC. 3. Survival Surgery : Animal recovers, for any length of time, from anesthesia used in a surgical procedure. 4. Acute Surgery : A non-survival surgical procedure in which euthanasia is performed prior to recovery from anesthesia. 5. Major Surgery : Any surgical intervention that penetrates and exposes a body cavity or any procedure which produces permanent impairment of physical or physiological functions. Examples of major surgery include (but are not limited to): a. surgical invasion of a body cavity b. injury and/or repair of tendon/ligament c. amputation of a limb d. enucleation e. orthopedic procedures involving surgical approach f. nephrectomy or nephrotomy 6. Minor Surgery : Any surgical intervention that does not ordinarily have the potential to result in impairment of a vital physical or physiological function. Examples of minor surgery include (but are not limited to): a. percutaneous or cutdown approach to artery or vein b. vessel catheterization c. tissue biopsy not involving surgical exposure of a body cavity d. skin or subcutaneous implants e. surgical repair of superficial injury","Species Covered: All Vertebrate Species All social animals will be pair- or group-housed unless otherwise described in this Policy and/or an exemption is described in an IACUC approved protocol. This allows for species-appropriate social groups to provide opportunities to express species-specific behaviors that meet or exceed regulatory requirements. 1. Background a. The Animal Welfare Act and The Guide describe basic behavioral and social management expectations in the broad areas of structural environment, social environment, and activity. General laboratory animal expectations assume that appropriate social interaction among members of the same species, or compatible species, is essential to normal development and wellbeing. Animals that are able to express species-specific behaviors are a more stable research platform and provide more accurate research data. An animal's species-typical natural social behavior should guide the appropriateness and level of social interaction with conspecifics or compatible species whether housed singly, in pairs, or in groups. 2. Exemptions to this policy a. SOCIAL INCOMPATIBILITY: Socially housed animals that demonstrate severe or prolonged incompatibility should be separated to prevent chronic stress, injury, and possibly death. If possible, attempts should be made to re-pair or re-group singly housed animals with other conspecifics. If incompatible animals are identified by the PI or research personnel, they can be separated; but the veterinary staff must be notified and consulted. Direction on the continuation of single housing due to documented incompatibility should be directed by the Attending Veterinarian or their designee. b. RESEARCH EXEMPTIONS: Exemptions to social housing based upon research needs must be considered and approved by the IACUC before initiation of the exemption and noted at the cage level. c. POST SURGICAL CARE: Animals may be housed singly during the immediate postoperative recovery period. Postoperative recovery is defined as from the time of surgery up to seven days following surgery or until 24 hours after external suture or bandage/wound dressings are removed. This specific housing is considered a positive animal welfare activity to promote the health and healing of the animal and is considered standard clinical veterinary care. Animals must be monitored several times on the day of reintroduction, as well as the following day, to ensure compatibility. Additional environmental enrichment is not required in postoperative single housing situations. d. CLINICAL VETERINARY CARE: The Attending Veterinarian or designee may exclude an animal from social housing based on animal heath, animal condition, or animal wellbeing. When the modifications are not part of the approved protocol, they must be in writing, specific for the affected animal(s), and written in the animal's medical record (USDA-covered), single housing card/veterinary examination card (non USDA-covered), or equivalent. e. ABSENCE OF CAGEMATE: The IACUC encourages protocol planning that minimizes animals remaining as single animals for extended periods of time. The IACUC recognizes that experiments may initially require or end in a cycle where a single animal remains, and in these cases, per ARCH SOP AOP0074, singly-housed animals will be provided with additional environmental enrichment in lieu of social housing. f. Sheep and swine will be singly housed for the first 24 hours following arrival in ARCH. Animals are then pair matched, based on veterinary evaluation. The process for evaluation, monitoring and exempting is further described in ARCH SOP AOP0081","Species Covered: All Vertebrate Species Physical restraint is the use of manual or mechanical means to limit some or all of an animal's normal movement. Restraint may be necessary for blood, urine or fecal collection, administration of a compound or for protocol related issues. Restraint may be necessary for brief or prolonged periods of time. 1. General Policy a. Brief periods (up to 5 minutes) of restraint for the purpose of performing routine clinical or experimental procedures do not require scientific justification or description in protocol descriptions. If a restraint device is to be used, it must be suitable to the size of animal. It must also be constructed in such a way that animals are not in discomfort or pain while immobilized, and research personnel are not at risk for injury. These devices must be constructed of material such that they can be washed and disinfected between uses. b. Prolonged restraint must be described and justified in the appropriate protocol. If appropriate, a diagram may be helpful to illustrate how the device looks and how it will be utilized. Scientific justification must include an assurance that this is essential to achieving research objectives. A literature search must provide key words that alternative methods could not be employed. Endpoints must be defined that necessitate temporary or permanent removal of the animal from the restraint procedure. Protocols must be approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee before such restraint can be employed. 2. Guidelines a. The following are guidelines suggested by the ""Guide"": i. Restraint devices are not to be considered normal methods of housing. ii. Restraint devices should not be used simply as a convenience in handling or managing animals. iii. The period of restraint should be the minimum required to accomplish the research objectives. iv. Animals to be placed in restraint devices should be given training with positive reinforcement to adapt to the equipment and personnel whenever possible. v. Provision should be made for observation of the animal at appropriate intervals, as determined by the IACUC. vi. Veterinary care should be provided if lesions or illnesses associated with restraint are observed. The presence of lesions, illness, or severe behavioral change often necessitates temporary or permanent removal of the animal from restraint. vii. Animals that fail to adapt should be removed from the study.","Species Covered: All Vertebrate Species Public Health Service (PHS) Policy requires institutions to establish and maintain proper measures to ensure the appropriate care and use of all animals involved in research, research training, and biological testing activities conducted or supported by the PHS. The PHS endorses the ""U.S. Government Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing, Research and Training,"" which state that, ""Investigators and other personnel shall be appropriately qualified and experienced for conducting procedures on living animals. Adequate arrangements shall be made for their in-service training, including the proper and humane care and use of laboratory animals."" 1. The Animal Welfare Act (AWA) contains several statements in 9 CFR 2.32 regarding training requirements and personnel qualifications: a. 2.32(a) ""It shall be the responsibility of the research facility to ensure that all scientists, research technicians, animal technicians, and other personnel involved in animal care, treatment, and use are qualified to perform their duties..."" b. 2.32(b) ""Training and instruction shall be made available, and the qualifications of personnel reviewed, with sufficient frequency to fulfill the research facility's responsibilities..."" c. 2.32(c) ""Training and instruction of personnel must include guidance in at least the following areas: i. Humane methods of animal maintenance and experimentation, including the basic needs of each species of animal, proper handling and care for the various species of animals used by the facility, proper pre-procedural and post-procedural care of animals, and aseptic surgical methods and procedures. ii. The concept, availability, and use of research or testing methods that limit the use of animals or minimize animal distress. iii. Proper use of anesthetics, analgesics, and tranquilizers for any species of animals used by the facility. iv. Methods whereby deficiencies in animal care and treatment are reported. v. Utilization of services available to provide information on appropriate methods of animal care and use, on alternatives to the use of live animals in research, that could prevent unintended and unnecessary duplication of research involving animals. 2. The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals states that ""Animal welfare regulations and PHS Policy require institutions to ensure that people caring for or using animals are qualified to do so"" and ""Investigators, technical personnel, trainees, and visiting investigators who perform animal anesthesia, surgery, or other experimental manipulations must be qualified through training or experience to accomplish these tasks in a humane and scientifically acceptable manner."" 3. Research Personnel a. Training requirements for research personnel are met in two ways. Typically, research personnel must complete Animal Use Orientation prior to working with research animals, being added to a protocol, or obtaining ARCH access. Occasionally, the training requirements of research personnel may be met without the investigator completing a formal orientation session. For example, if the investigator will be performing the entire procedure supervised by the ARCH veterinary staff, working with animals in a teaching or training protocol, or providing instruction on equipment use. b. Secondly, in order for an investigator to be added to a protocol, the PI must complete an Add Staff Form, indicating what procedures the investigator will be performing, and the investigator's training and experience, as it relates to the procedures involved. Add Staff Forms that do not contain this information are not approved until the PI provides the relevant information. 4. ARCH Personnel a. When an Animal Care Technician first begins working in ARCH, management staff review departmental policies and procedures with them, as well as an ARCH safety presentation. The new Animal Care Technician then works with and are trained by another individual, experienced in the area they will be assigned to. A Lead Animal Care Technician for that area is responsible for oversight and completes a form that indicates what training the new employee has received, who provided the training, and the date on which the training was completed. b. In addition to on-the-job training, all ARCH Animal Care Technicians attend biweekly meetings on animal care and use. Topics include diseases in laboratory animals, the recognition and detection of disease or illness in animals, safety issues, review of the ARCH evacuation plan, zoonoses, and various husbandry and regulatory issues. Additionally, the staff review policy, procedure, and program changes and/or updates. Back Safety Workshops are held to train ARCH staff to use proper procedures for lifting, pushing, and pulling, in order to prevent back injuries. c. Boston Children's Hospital is an Institutional Member of American Association for Laboratory Animal Science (AALAS). An AALAS Certification Preparatory Course is offered annually at MIT. Boston Children's Hospital pays the tuition for ARCH personnel to attend this course as well as the certification exam fees. In the annual performance review, a portion of the animal care technicians' merit increases are based on their ability to maintain and expand appropriate animal care and use knowledge and skills. AALAS Certification is one way to achieve recognition of development and is strongly encouraged.","1. Enteral feeding is the preferred route to deliver nutrition because it: a. meets nutritional requirements better than parenteral nutrition; b. promotes gastrointestinal maturity and maintains mucosal integrity; and c. is safer than parenteral nutrition, for example avoiding the need for central venous catheters. 2. In addition to nutritional benefits, human milk in particular has immunoprotective properties and benefits to infant health. 3. Use of a standardized approach to feeding may be associated with reduction in NEC risk.",

For sterile compounding all jewelry must be removed. 2. Hand washing occurs after donning booties, hair cover, beard cover (if applicable). 3. Keep nails clean and neatly trimmed (not extend past finger tips) to minimize particle shedding and avoid glove punctures. 4. Nail products (e.g. polish, artificial nails, and extenders) must not be worn. 5. Remove visible debris from underneath fingernails under warm running water using a disposable nail cleaner. 6. Wash hands and forearms up to the elbows with plain soap and water for at least 30 seconds. 7. Dry hands and forearms to the elbows completely with low-lint disposable towels. 8. Hands must be sanitized with alcohol based hand rub or IPA before donning sterile gloves 9. Apply an alcohol-based hand rub or IPA to dry skin following the manufacturer’s instructions for the volume of product to use. 10. Apply product to one hand and rub hands together, covering all surfaces of hands and fingers, until hands are dry. 11. Allow hands to dry thoroughly before donning sterile gloves.","Hand hygiene can be accomplished by use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, routine handwashing, hand antisepsis, and surgical scrub. 1. Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer Use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers is the preferred method for hand hygiene. The purpose of alcohol- based hand sanitizers is to inhibit or kill transient and resident flora. These agents do not remove soil or debris; therefore, if hands are visibly soiled, handwashing with soap and water should be done first. The technique for hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand sanitizer is: a. Apply enough alcohol-based hand sanitizer to cover the entire surface of both hands and fingers. b. Rub the product vigorously onto all surfaces of both hands, covering all surfaces until dry, approximately 20-30 seconds. 2. Handwashing The purpose of handwashing is to mechanically remove soil and debris and reduce the number of transient flora acquired by recent contact with patients or the environment. The steps for routine handwashing are: a. Thoroughly wet hands. b. Apply a hospital provided handwashing agent, enough to cover all hand surfaces. c. Rub with friction all areas of hands and fingers for at least 20-30 seconds, paying close attention to the areas under the fingernails and between fingers. i. Ensure cleaning palms, fingers, between fingers, tips of fingers, thumbs d. Rinse hands thoroughly. e. Dry hands with a single use paper towel. f. If the sink does not have automatic shut-off, use a paper towel to turning off water. 3. Hand antisepsis Antisepsis is defined as any procedure that significantly reduces microbial flora on skin and mucous membranes. The goal of hand antisepsis is to remove soil and debris and to reduce both transient and resident flora on the hands. Hand antisepsis can be achieved by using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer or by performing handwashing with antimicrobial agent, i.e., 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) instead of plain soap or detergent. Perform hand antisepsis: a. Before invasive procedures or care of an invasive device (e.g. IV catheter, foley, chest tube, tracheostomy). b. After contact with patients colonized or infected with microorganisms of special clinical or epidemiological significance (e.g. VRE, MRSA). 4. Surgical Scrub The purpose of surgical scrub is to mechanically remove soil, debris, and transient flora and to reduce resident flora prior to and for the duration of a surgical procedure. The goal is to prevent wound contamination by microorganisms present on the hands of the surgical staff. Surgical scrub technique is detailed in the Boston Children's Hospital OR Policy & Procedure Manual.","1. Apply the antimicrobial surgical scrub agent to wet hands and forearms using the accompanying soft, nonabrasive brush. 2. Include all four sides of fingers, and both hands (including web spaces), and forearms in a hand scrub. 3. Keep hands above the elbows and rinse hands/forearms under running water after the scrub is completed. 4. Keep both hands and forearms held above the elbows and away from the body after the scrub is completed to prevent contamination. 5. Dry hands and forearms with a sterile towel prior to donning a sterile gown and gloves.","Alcohol-based antiseptic hand rub. 1. Identify an alcohol-based antiseptic hand rub. This is not hand sanitizer. 2. Dispense 1 pump (2 ml) into the palm of one hand. 3. Dip fingertips of opposite hand into the antiseptic hand rub, and work it under the fingernails. 4. Spread the remaining antiseptic hand rub over the hand and up the forearm to just above the elbow. 5. Dispense another 2 ml of lotion into the other hand, repeat procedure. 6. Disperse another 2 ml of lotion into either hand and reapply to all aspects of both hands up to the elbows. 7. Rub hands together until completely dry before donning gown and gloves.","1. Remove all hand, wrist and arm jewelry. 2. Remove nail polish. 3. Clean finger nail beds under running water using a disposable nail cleaner. 4. Perform hand hygiene.

There are two exceptions to this rule: emancipated minors and mature minors.","• A patient under the age of 18 is considered a minor under Massachusetts law and the following individuals may consent to treatment on behalf of a minor: ◦ Parents with legal custody of a minor; ◦ Court appointed legal guardian (guardian), which is defined as the following: ▪ A biological or adoptive parent who has not had their parental rights taken away by a court order; ▪ A court appointed individual with authority to make some or all decisions for a person (need to ensure that the decision-making includes medical) without the capacity to consent; or ▪ An individual with a valid court order proving that individual's designation as a legal guardian as well as a description of the scope of the legal decision-making authority (including decisions regarding medical care and treatment) contemplated by the guardianship. ◦ Duly authorized delegates named by the legal guardian of a minor, evidenced by a properly executed Delegation of Authority or a Massachusetts Caregiver Affidavit; or ◦ A state agency (e.g., Department of Children and Families (DCF), Department of youth Services (DYS), or Department of Mental Health (DMH)) with custody of a child under a ""care and protection"". ▪ The agency or its delegate (e.g., a foster parent) with custody under a care and protection is the only party who can provide consent unless the proposed care is considered ""extraordinary,"" in which case a court would need to issue an order authorizing the extraordinary care and treatment. ▪ If the state agency is only involved generally with coordinating services through a ""care requiring assistance"" arrangement, then the parent of the patient continues to have legal authority for consent. ▪ The Department of Children and Families (DCF) may delegate to foster parents the right to authorize routine medical and dental care, emergency care, or specific services (surgical or other) to children placed in their home. Written authorization to consent should be presented in the form of either a Foster Parent Authorization Card or a Child-Specific Foster Parent Agreement. ▪ Special services such as psychiatric services may be provided if the DCF social worker has listed these services on the Child Specific Agreement Form . Note, in an emergency, the patient should be treated whether or not consent has been obtained ◦ A minor is considered ""Emancipated"" to be able to make their own decisions if they have obtained a court order to end the rights and responsibilities of the parents. It is important to note that the court order can grant either : (1) a ""Partial Emancipation"" to allow the minor to make decisions about themselves, but still be entitled to financial support from the parents (most common); or (2) ""Complete Emancipation"" to allow minor to make any decision about themselves (NOT common). ◦ Regardless of emancipation, a minor may also be determined to be a ""mature minor"" who can consent to their own health care without parental involvement or consent, only under the following circumstances: ▪ Married, widowed, or divorced; ▪ Pregnant or believes herself to be pregnant; ▪ A parent of a child (he/she may also give consent for the medical/dental care of the child); ▪ Enlisted in the military on a full-time active duty basis; ▪ Living separate and apart from parents or a legal guardian and is managing their own financial affairs; ▪ Reasonably believes they have contracted a disease dangerous to the public health, and they seek treatment for such disease; ▪ Seeking their own treatment for: drug addiction (provided that they are at least 12 years old and two or more physicians determined the child is drug dependent), family planning services, or treatment for sexually transmitted diseases (including HIV or AIDS); or ▪ Seeking to voluntarily commit themselves for mental health treatment without parental consent (provided they are at least 16 years of age). Note: Consents by a mature minor are confidential. Parent/guardians should not be informed about the procedure unless: (1) the provider reasonably believes that the minor's condition is dangerous to life or limb; or (2) the minor agrees. Such agreements must be documented in the patient's medical record. If the mature minor's parent and/or guardian is not notified, make sure that the finance office is also notified, so confidentiality is maintained and special payment arrangements are put into place if necessary.","• A minor (under the age of 18) in Massachusetts who is pregnant or reasonably believes she is pregnant is deemed to be a mature minor for purposes of receiving healthcare services. Such patients have the legal right to sign their own consent for treatment (including any tests). If the BCH staff becomes aware that a minor patient is or believes they are pregnant, the staff should discuss treatment and the informed consent form with the minor in a confidential manner. A mature minor has the right to sign their own informed consent or may continue to have their parent/guardian sign the form on their behalf. BCH staff should also be aware that if a pregnant minor chooses to seek treatment without knowledge of the parent/ guardian, they should document that in the patient's medical record while also informing the minor that the parent/guardian may be able to access this information from the patient's chart. Further that the mature minor would need to contact the BCH HIM department to request such information be made confidential.","• No Boston Children's employee may be simultaneously employed by any BCH Affiliate or receive compensation in any form from any BCH Affiliate outside of the Boston Children's payroll system. • No individual may be an independent contractor, volunteer, intern, or otherwise perform services at Boston Children's without pay unless the individual has applied for and been approved for such status in accordance with Hospital policy and applicable law. • This Policy does not create any contractual obligations between BCH and any employee for the payment of compensation in any particular amount or for any particular time period.

Included in the identification process are the following: ◦ Verify patient identification using two unique identifiers and active verification. ◦ If the patient and/or parents/guardians have Limited English Proficiency or are non-English speaking, utilize Interpreter Services according to hospital policy (see Medical Interpreters ). ◦ Active verification that the Radiology order matches the patient's expectation for what procedures will be performed. ◦ Active verification that the signs and symptoms indicated are appropriate for the examination to be performed. ◦ If an inpatient or Emergency Room patient does not have an ID band in place, contact the clinician caring for the patient to identify the patient and provide an ID band for the patient prior to the procedure. ◦ Patients from other institutions should have a BCH ID band in place regardless of the one that may be present from the other institution. • For plain Films and portables, verify that: ◦ Lead markers are present. Films without lead markers must be repeated unless a QA person can validate the Right or Left side on the image. ◦ Bar Code the order and verify the demographics are correct on the patient worklist. • For MR, CT, Nuclear Medicine, IR, US verify that: ◦ Protocol matches the order. ◦ The orientation of the patient is identified correctly on the acquisition device. ◦ The image has laterality identification where appropriate. • Identifying Conjoined Twins: ◦ Each of the Twins should be labeled with a marker on the image (ie: TWIN A is labeled with a lead A, TWIN B with a lead B) in addition to left right designation where applicable. ◦ If twins are conjoined such that they cannot be imaged separately, or because of the organs they may share, a complete record for each of the twins should be kept. 1. There should be 2 orders, one order for each twin. When the images cannot be separated (ie: one portable chest x-ray that is done that includes both) then the images are sent to SYNAPSE Twin A file. The report that is generated should then be copied to the TWIN B record (with mention that images are part of TWIN A file). 2. When the order is for only 1 of the twins, there is only 1 order placed, with only 1 report. 3. When the exam includes both twins and the images can be separated into 2 different SYNAPSE files (like an US of each head), then there are 2 separate reports generated. 4. For every order that is generated, there should be a charge.","Boston Children's Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB) may determine that research is minimal risk if the skin biopsy guidance have been followed accordingly. • Skin biopsies may be approved under the category of minimal risk in accordance of the following procedures. • If a protocol d oes not meet criteria, it does not mean the protocol will be disapproved.

When can a patient be dispached,"1. The RN or the ordering clinician reassesses and documents the need for continued restraint. When there is no indication of the continued need for restraint, remove the restraint and document the removal. Violent/self-destructive behavior or seclusion 1. A debriefing occurs following the restraint incident to evaluate the effectiveness of the procedure and patient outcomes and, if appropriate, the patient's family and the staff involved as soon as possible.","Why debrief? Debriefing is an essential mechanism to enhance interdisciplinary communication about a death and to reduce burnout in providers and rotating trainees. Without debriefing, many team members are left with the feeling that they are alone in their experience of a death. Even a 15 minute debrief can help and set the stage for further conversations and respectful communication between team members. When to debrief, or Why debrief immediately? Scheduling a debriefing for a later date so that everyone who was involved with a death can attend is a very challenging task and often fails to occur. Debriefing immediately does not rule out other debriefings being scheduled later. It can be scheduled before or after bringing child to the morgue but after parents have left the hospital. The neighboring RN or CRN can cover the bedside RN's other patients so that s/he may participate. Who should initiate/lead/attend the debrief? Anyone on the team can (and should) ask for the debrief to be arranged. Generally co-facilitated by fellow or attending and bedside RN, charge RN, or CRN but anyone on the team can lead a debrief (see directions above). The debrief should be multidisciplinary, as perspectives from all of the different disciplines will be helpful and all disciplines can benefit from knowing how the rest of the team is thinking and feeling about the patient and his or her death. Charge nurse, CRN, or bedside nurse should alert RN, RT, CA, clergy, and SW. Fellow/Attending should alert NP's, residents, fellows, and attending. Other services may be invited (General Surgery, Oncology, Neurosurgery, etc.).

What is a non research grant,"• Non-Research : Any grant that is not a systematic, intensive study intended to increase knowledge or understanding of the subject studied, a systematic study specifically directed toward applying new knowledge to meet a recognized need, or a systematic application of knowledge to the production of useful materials, devices, and systems or methods, including design, development, and improvement of prototypes and new processes to meet specific requirements. (Defined by National Institutes of Health) • Grant or Contract : An award (including a contract) given by an external sponsor with a specific purpose for a specified period of time with a specified budget.","The intent of this policy is to create a guideline for those applying for non-research sponsored funding. Because there are strict guidelines and reporting requirements that must be followed with these types of grants and contracts, everyone responsible must be aware of their roles and responsibilities in the application and oversight of these funds. This policy addresses the practice of applying for Non-research grants or contracts (Grants); including State- funded contracts, and the oversight and management of the funding once it has been awarded. This policy is governed by the following major policy statements: 1. It is the policy of Children's Hospital Boston to comply with all sponsor requirements for budgeting, expenditure, accounting and reporting in connection with grants or service contracts. 2. No application for funding, including responses to state-issued Requests for Proposals or applications for federal funds administered by the state, will be submitted by the Hospital (or any Hospital department or program) without prior approval of the application by the Vice President of the department applying for the grant and the Office of Sponsored Programs. Any instances where the applicant feels that the funding may not be a grant or contract will be reviewed on a case by case basis by the Finance department to determine the appropriate course of action. 3. Oversight of any grant is assigned to a particular individual in the department or program performing the relevant services. That individual is responsible for following applicable procedures of CHB's administrative offices and for compliance with grant requirements. 4. All invoicing is performed by the Finance Department unless an alternative arrangement is specifically approved by the sponsor and the CHB finance department","1. Applying for Non-Research Grants or Contracts a. As soon as an opportunity for funding is identified, the applicant (PI) or the responsible administrator must obtain the approval to apply for the grant or contract by their respective Vice President before pursuing the opportunity. b. The responsible departmental administrator prepares all necessary application materials, including the budget. c. All application materials and budgets are to be submitted to the Office of Sponsored Programs along with a completed CHeRP (Children's Hospital eResearch Portal) online cover sheet for review of budget and administrative components at least 5 business days prior to the submission deadline. Insufficient or incomplete materials will be returned to the administrator for revision and resubmission. d. The Office of Sponsored Programs then signs off on the application materials. If OSP determines that legal review is required, OSP will obtain review from the Office of General Counsel prior to signing off on the application. e. When approved, the application package will be given back to the departmental administrator for submission to the sponsor. In cases in which an electronic submission is required or the sponsor requires an authorized official submit the application; Office of Sponsored Programs will submit the application. f. This process should also be followed for existing grants upon renewal. 2. Award Acceptance a. Once the sponsor's official notice of award has been received or the contract has been issued, the Office of Sponsored Programs will ensure that the agreement is fully executed by obtaining the appropriate CHB and sponsor signatures. The Office of Sponsored Programs will enter the award data into CHeRP, which will notify the Office of the Research Controller of the awarded grant and the appropriate project ID number will be established in PeopleSoft in order for the Department to begin utilizing the grant funds. b. If the grant/contract involves subcontractor institutions, OSP and/or the departmental administrator may have to work with the Office of General Counsel to draft the subcontract agreements depending on the nature of the work to be performed. 3. Oversight of the Grant/Contract Once Awarded a. Finance staff will work with the departmental administrator to establish processes to support regular timely invoicing under the contract or grant. This could involve specific reporting on information required to support the invoice or the annual Uniform Financial Report that CHB must file with the Commonwealth (in the case of state-funded grants or contracts). b. Finance staff will also support the departmental administrator in all financial aspects of the grant once it has been executed.","The purpose of this policy is to define the criteria related to space and institutional appointments required to submit proposals for extramural research funding though Boston Children's Hospital (BCH). Scientific collaboration among researchers at the academic institutions, hospitals and other research institutes in Boston is extensive and vary widely from simple collaborations to joint appointments with research space at multiple institutions. Although most researchers have one home institution, they may have appointments and relationships with multiple institutions. Extramural research grants are most frequently submitted through the home institution of the principal investigator (PI) where the majority of the research will be conducted. Researchers with space and research programs at multiple institutions generally submit a grant proposal through the institution where the bulk of the work will be performed.","Companies that provide external support in the form of an educational program grant are not to be involved in any aspect of the program development including needs, learning objectives, content, faculty, format or delivery and/or evaluation. A commercial interest cannot take the role of non-accredited partner in a co- sponsorship relationship.",

How long should it take to respond to a page,"The following is the procedure that should be followed whenever paging an on-call technologist: 1. Direct page. Call extension 5-7243 (5-PAGE), enter pager number and call back extension or use the Phone Page Search online Quick Page system . 2. If no response after 10 minutes, call home phone or cell phone number and also try direct page again. 3. If no response after 5 more minutes, call page operator (extension 5-6363) and have them page the on- call technologist. 4. If no response after 5 more minutes, once again, call home phone or cell phone number of person on call. If no success, assume pager is not working and escalate to the Modality Operations Manager. (Note: this is 20 minutes from the initial direct page.)","This document describes how to respond to a patient who is more than 30 minutes late.

Preparation . The most important facilities to a response plan are to know how to use it once it is in place. Knowing how to respond to an incident before it occurs can save valuable time and effort in the long run. 2. Identification . Identify whether or not an incident has occurred. If one has occurred, the Incident Response Team can take the appropriate actions. Identification may come from security sensors and/or agents or manual observance of an incident by a BCH patient, user or ISD staff. 3. Containment . Involves limiting the scope and magnitude of an incident. Because so many incidents observed currently involve malicious code, incidents can spread rapidly. This can cause the destruction and loss of data. As soon as an incident is recognized, the Incident Response Team must immediately begin working on containment. 4. Eradication . Removing the cause of the incident can be a difficult process. It can involve virus removal, removing user permissions, and/or dismissing employees. 5. Recovery . Restoring a system to its normal business status is essential. Once a restore has been performed, it is also important to verify that the restore operation was successful and that systems are back to its normal condition. 6. Follow-up . Some incidents require considerable time and effort. It is common that once the incident appears to be contained and remedied; there is little interest in devoting any more effort to the incident. Performing follow-up activity is, however, one of the most critical activities in the response procedure. This follow-up can support any efforts to prosecute those who have broken the law. This includes changing any policies that may need to be narrowed down or be changed altogether.",

Where can radioactive materials be used,"To indicate that an item is radioactive, or that there is radioactive material used or stored in that area a ""CAUTION RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS"" sign must be posted, This includes: • Doors to all areas where radioactive materials are used, stored, and/or handled. • Refrigerators, centrifuges, incubators, hoods, sinks, and any other equipment in which radioactive material is used or stored. A ""CAUTION RADIATION AREA"" sign must be posted where the dose equivalent rate is greater than or equal to 5 mrem/hr @ 30cm from the source of radiation. All other contaminated items must be labeled with ""radioactive"" tape. This includes: benchtops, experiments, pipette-aids, water baths, sinks, test tube racks, microfuges, and radioactive waste.","Species Covered: All Rodent Species Purpose: To outline the radiation safety procedures required when using radioactive materials in animals. This document provides guidance on radiation safety as applied to the use of IACUC approved protocols that involve the use of radioactive materials in animals at Children's. 1. General a. Radioactive materials can be used in animals only with the approval of the Radiation Safety Committee (through a valid Permit) and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (through a valid Protocol which undergoes separate review by Radiation Safety Staff). b. All requirements for the safe use of radioactive materials as established in the Radiation Safety Manual remain in effect for procedures involving animals. These include the requirements for training, monitoring, waste disposal and personal surveys. c. Injection or administration areas should be surveyed (by meter and wipe test) after the administration of radioactive material. This survey must be documented and retained for inspection. d. Cages housing radioactive animals must be labeled (tags provided by Radiation Safety), and must be changed by the investigator (or appropriate designated staff). e. Animal carcasses and bedding should be disposed of through the Radiation Safety Office as soon as they are generated. Disposable cages should be used whenever allowed by the ARCH veterinary staff. Cages that are not disposable should be cleaned, surveyed with an appropriate survey meter and wipe tested by the investigator (or designated staff) performing the experiment before being released to ARCH for cleaning. f. Required postings, tags, and waste bags are provided by Radiation Safety. 2. Equipment a. The following equipment should be used in meeting the above requirements: i. Calibrated Radiation Survey Meter appropriate for the isotope being measured ii. Radiation tags and labels (provided by the Radiation Safety Office) iii. Waste bags (provided by Radiation Safety) iv. Wipes, swabs, etc. for wipe tests v. Liquid Scintillation or Gamma counter vi.

Common violations include: • Candy wrappers, soda cans, and other food products in lab trash buckets. • Empty coffee cups or water bottles on desks. • Lunch bags on desk, in desk drawers, or in book bags. • Storing food or drinks in a cold room or lab refrigerators. Every time you handle radioactive material you must wear Protective Clothing: • Gown to cover arms • At least one pair of gloves • Safety glasses - for any hazardous materials that may splash, and to protect eyes from 32 P. • Closed-toe shoes. To minimize your risk of personal contamination: • Wash your hands frequently throughout the day as described in the Infection Control Manual Hand Hygiene policy . • The best practice is to wash every time you change gloves. • Never pipette by mouth. • Label contaminated items as radioactive","Many researchers and staff in the Division of Nuclear Medicine and Clinical Laboratories use radioactive materials in their work. Because most radioactive materials are in liquid form, a spill could expose a number of people to the substance. • State regulations require an institution to establish a Radiation Safety Committee (RSC) before a license to use isotopes for medical or research purposes is issued. A Cardiology Physician chairs the Radiation Safety Committee. • To ensure radiation safety at Children's Hospital, direct all questions about procurement, storage, handling, use, and disposal of radio-isotopes or radiation-generating equipment to the Radiation Safety Committee (RSC) through the Radiation Safety Officer On-Call (RAOC), at ext 5-7516. • Radionuclide or radiation-generating equipment users must know about: ◦ the relevant legal requirements ◦ the Radiation Safety policies and procedures ◦ the Radiation Safety Committee","To comply with local, state and federal regulations while transporting radioactivity, you must: • Never bring radioactive material outside the facility without express approval from the RSO. • Inform the RSO if you plan to transfer radioactive material to another institution.

Avoid soaps and wet wipes • Avoid excess rubbing and wiping • Consider Domeboro® * or Aveno® soak BID PRN • Document skin status in nursing progress note • Consult with local skin care SME or CNS if IAD continues to worsen Consult with local skin care SME or CNS if IAD continues to worsen","1. The most common cause of IAD is from cannulation of the aorta [1,2]. Particular attention to detail should be appreciated during the initial test of aortic cannula placement with flow from the heart-lung machine (HLM). a. The perfusionist should observe all of the following to confirm correct placement of the aortic cannula: i. An unclamped, unobstructed arterial line should read a system pressure that approximates the systolic blood pressure of the patient. ii. Adequate flow (typically a cardiac index flow of 0.5-1) should be given through the arterial pump to assess proper pressure and flow before establishing CPB [3]: 1. System pressure is expected to increase slightly. 2. Gradual increase of patient blood pressure, cardiac filling pressures, and hemodynamic waveforms should be observed. b. Conversely speaking, the following observations may indicate incorrect placement of the aortic cannula or an aortic dissection [2]: i. An unclamped, unobstructed arterial line reading a system pressure inconsistent with the systolic blood pressure of the patient. ii. Large, dramatic increase or ""spike"" in system pressure upon delivering flow through the arterial pump. iii. Hemodynamic instability upon delivering test volume from HLM. iv. If able to visualize surgical field, a marked hematoma may be observed at the site of cannulation. 2. The perfusionist should assure that clear communication of test volume findings are made. If the findings are normal, cannulation should proceed. 3. If the test volume findings are abnormal, preparations should be made by the perfusionist to anticipate an alternate arterial cannulation site. Selection of this site will depend on the extent of the dissection, the size of the patient, and nature of initial surgical procedure. Appropriate cannulas, connectors, and tubing should be readily available. 4. Extra attention should be placed upon the testing of the NEW aortic cannula. Additionally, the perfusionist should be diligent regarding pump system pressure trends throughout the bypass run. 5. Consideration should be given regarding systemic cooling of the patient. Communication with the anesthesia team should be made regarding blanket temperature and potential for placing ice on the head [4]. 6. In the event of IAD involving the ascending aorta, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest with or without selective cerebral perfusion should be considered. Current research suggests temperatures lower than 26C and selective antegrade cerebral perfusion as the method for mitigating the most damage [5].","Aortic dissection is defined as a disruption within the intima of a vessel, commonly caused by laceration, compression, or torsion of the aorta. While this is more common in the adult population and is a condition that often necessitates surgical intervention, the occurrence of aortic dissection in the intraoperative period (IAD) is relatively low. Most centers report an incidence of less than 1% [1]. The incidence is thought to be even lower in the pediatric population. To date, limited research has been done on the occurrence of IAD in the pediatric population and concern should arise in the event of such an emergency as perr-reviewed standard procedures have yet to be established.","• Investigational New Drug (IND) Application • Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) • Electronic Systems, Electronic Records, and Electronic Signatures in Clinical Investigations Questions and Answers","I Insufficiency IAA Interrupted Aortic Arch IART (Atrial Flutter) Intra Atrial re-enterant 427.32 tachycardia IAS Intact Atrial Septum IBD Irritable Bowel Disease ICBC Illiac Crest Bone Graft ICE Intracardiac Echocardiogram ICP Intracranial Pressure Monitoring IDCM Idiopathic Dilated Cardiomyopathy IDM Infant of Diabetic Mother IHSS Idiopathic Hypertrophic Subaortic 425.1 Stenosis IIAC Idiopathic infantile arterial calcification Linked as a autosomal disorder – codes (added 8/1/11) 74358, 74769 and 7585 - DL IM Intramuscular ABBREV TERM(S) Comments IMA I…..?

Drug/alcohol abuse issues,"Boston Children's Hospital recognizes that drug or alcohol abuse is an illness that can have a debilitating effect on all aspects of your personal and professional life. All clinicians are encouraged to come to terms with the existence of drug or alcohol abuse problems and to seek and accept the help necessary to correct such problems. Clinicians may seek assistance with these problems through the Office for Clinician Support, the Employee Assistance Program, the Occupational Health Service, and/or the Massachusetts Medical Society Physician Health Service. If you are concerned about a colleague's use of alcohol or other substances, you should speak with his/her supervisor or chief. You may also call any of the listed numbers for assistance. The hospital will make every reasonable effort to maintain confidentiality and to assist all personnel through the rehabilitation process. Reporting a concern about a fellow physician may save his/her life, as early intervention is associated with better prognosis for recovery. In addition, the regulations of the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine mandate that health care providers report any person who there is ""reasonable basis to believe"" is practicing while impaired by alcohol, drugs, mental instability, or physical disability, or who is a habitual user of a psychoactive substance.

How does the evacuation policy differ between boston and waltham,"• To maintain patient care delivery during partial or full evacuation of Boston Children's Hospital Waltham. An evacuation is the removal of patients, staff and/or visitors in response to any emergency situation, which renders the environment unsafe for occupancy or prevents the delivery of necessary patient care. • To prevent and address injuries and damage to the facility , establish interim provisions for affected areas, coordinate effectively with Public Safety Services, and return the institution to normal operations as soon as possible. • To minimize disruption of operations if there is a loss of mechanical services, provide information and resources for maintaining operations, and restore services as soon as possible.","Building and/or patient evacuation or relocation may be necessary if there is an event that threatens the safety of patients, visitors, or employees. • The Satellite Administrator on Call (AOC) is responsible for development and maintenance of evacuation plans for areas occupied by Boston Children's Hospital at Waltham. • Each tenant is responsible for development and maintenance of their area-specific evacuation plans. These plans must be coordinated facility-wide.","This plan contains the following terms: Emergency Operations A location used to organize emergency response. Also known as a Center (EOC) Command Center. At BCH Waltham, the default EOC location is the Boardroom. The Satellite AOC will announce an alternate location if needed. Fire wall Firewalls designed to prevent spread of smoke and flames are constructed between all buildings in the BCH Waltham complex. Adjacent buildings are safe areas of refuge once you pass through and close the specially marked ""fire doors."" Full Evacuation Transfer patients to alternative areas/buildings, an outside area or other hospitals. Evacuate building from the top down as evacuation at lower levels can be accelerated if the danger increases rapidly. Partial Evacuation Transfer patients within the hospital as follows Horizontal Evacuation Move through fire doors to an adjacent building or Safety Zone on the same floor. If fire or smoke threatens the new area, evacuate horizontally again. Use horizontal evacuation whenever possible, especially for inpatients and individuals who cannot use stairs. Vertical Evacuation Move via an exit stairway to a safe area on another floor or outside the building. Evacuate vertically if all horizontal options are exhausted. Vertical evacuation is more difficult due to stairways, which requires carrying of non-ambulatory individuals. Do not use elevators in the building involved in a fire. Position in Charge The Position in Charge is the individual designated for each department or work area who is in charge of emergency response for that work area. The Department Evacuation Checklist lists the Position in Charge. R.A.C.E. Rescue, Alarm, Close Doors, Evacuate following department's evacuation plan. Safety Zone Firewalls/Smoke barriers separate each building, which are designed to restrict the spread of smoke and flames. Evacuate patients horizontally from the involved Safety Zone through specially labeled Fire Doors to the uninvolved Safety Zone on the same floor. Patient Tracking Form The Department Patient Tracking Form should be completed for the patients being evacuated from the affected area(s). The form should be faxed or delivered to the Emergency Operations Center at least every 30 minutes. Additional detail is contained within this Evacuation Plan. Staging Area Form If a Staging Area is established, the Staging Area Patient Tracking Form will be used to collect information on evacuated patients as they arrive in the designated area. This form should be faxed or delivered to the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at least every 30 minutes. Additional detail is contained within this Evacuation Plan. Staging Area Centralized location for receipt, prioritization, and transfer of all evacuated patients under the direction of the Staging Area Coordinator. Location will be communicated at the time of the event and is dependent upon the identification of a safe location. Family Area Designated area to coordinate inquiries by phone or in person of patient family members. This area will be established if necessary and the location will be determined at the time of the event and is dependent upon the identification of a safe location. Media Area Designated area to coordinate inquiries and provide briefings for the media under the direction of Public Affairs. This area will be established if necessary and the location will be determined at the time of the event and is dependent upon the identification of a safe location.","• If evacuation may be required for fire alarm, smoke, or fire follow R.A.C.E. and refer to the Building Fire Evacuation Plan. This plan describes the evacuation procedures of each building, which depends on its construction and fire safety features. • If staff hears an announcement of activation of Evacuation Procedures for their area, evacuation should be conducted immediately following their Department Evacuation Plan . If the entire floor is to be evacuated and horizontal evacuation is not possible, vertical evacuation using the safest route should be conducted via the exit stairwell. • Should the nature and magnitude of the event require the involvement from outside agencies, evacuation instructions will be coordinated with the Satellite AOC. • Instruct parents to stay with their children and ask them to assist in relocation. • Identify patient areas/rooms that have been vacated. If vacant, place a room empty notification on the door (available from the Safety Department) on the corridor side entrance leading to the room. This placement will ensure that the room isn't entered again, once deemed vacant. • Do a sweep to ensure all persons are evacuated. Check bathrooms Remember children may hide when frightened • An announcement/instructions will indicate if elevators may be used Injuries • People injured during the incident who need medical treatment may be triaged at a safe place near the site by available staff. • For medical emergencies, alert the WALTHAM Code Blue Team at 5-5555 and specify Waltham location. • Call 0-911.","A full evacuation will be undertaken only with the specific instructions of the Satellite AOC. All individual units/departments including administrative areas and patient care areas should refer to their Departmental Evacuation Plan for primary evacuation information. The full evacuation information contained in this section is intended to supplement the information contained in Department Specific Evacuation Plans and builds on the information provided in the previous pages of this Evacuation Plan. Coordination The Satellite AOC will coordinate a full evacuation with assistance from first responder agencies that may be on site including Waltham Fire Department and/or Police Department. Additional assistance may be required from regional and state emergency management/response agencies, depending on the magnitude and nature of the event. Additional support may be provided through Transfer Agreements with participating institutions within and outside the BCH Waltham facility. General Guidelines for Full Evacuation • The Department Patient Tracking Form will be used to account for and document disposition of every patient evacuated from the affected area(s). • If necessary, a Staging Area will be identified as a designated safe destination for the evacuated patients, as appropriate. This area also serves as a point of departure if patients need to be transported to alternate care sites. The Staging Area Patient Tracking Form will be completed for all patients arriving in that location and the information sent to the Emergency Operations Center (EOC), where patient information will be coordinated and communicated to the various alternate care sites and family area. • If necessary, the Satellite AOC will establish a Family Area in a safe location, as appropriate. This area will is a meeting place for families awaiting patient information, and staffed by as determined by the Director of Patient Care Services. • If necessary, a designated area for the media will be identified by the Satellite AOC and established in a safe location, as appropriate. This area will be coordinated and staffed by Marketing and Communications or person so designated by Satellite AOC. • If necessary, the Satellite AOC will establish a designated area will serve as the triage area for critical patients awaiting transport to another healthcare facility, and provide clinical treatment to patients, staff and family members needing care as a result of the evacuation process. • When patients are evacuated to another location, designated BCH personnel will accompany them to their temporary location, including other healthcare facilities. Preparation for Evacuation of Patient Areas Classification of Patients Inpatients Upon notification of an evacuation, the Position in Charge (PIC) will designate staff member (nurses or physicians) regularly assigned to patient care area duties to immediately screen their patients and classify these patients by name and room number into the Department Patient Tracking Form as follows: • Ambulatory patients able to be moved immediately without assistance • Patients requiring stretcher transport • Patients requiring wheelchair transport • Patients who cannot be moved unless absolutely necessary • Oxygen and ventilator dependant patients • Disposition of medications, patient chart and personal belongings • Presence of family members for notification purposes Ambulatory Patients Upon notification of an evacuation, the Position in Charge (PIC) will designate a staff member (nurse or physician) to immediately screen the patients that have already arrived on the floor. Each patient should be assigned to one of two categories: • Patients that do not require immediate care or continued monitoring • Patients that do require immediate care or continued monitoring Patients that do not require immediate care or monitoring will be evacuated from the building and will be free to leave the hospital area, if deemed safe to do so. If patients are unable to leave the local area due to safety concerns, a designated place will be established in order for them to wait until they are able to leave the vicinity. Depending on the nature and magnitude of the event, these patients may choose to wait in a designated area and return to the clinic after the ""all clear"" has been announced. Patients that require care or monitoring will be evacuated from the area with appropriate levels of support necessary to maximize their safety. Disposition and location of all patients should be documented on the Patient Tracking Form. See additional instructions below. All patients will be called as soon as possible to reschedule their appointments. For All Patients The completed Department Patient Tracking Form should be given to the Position in Charge and a copy faxed (781-216-2297) or delivered to the EOC or other designated location if the EOC is not operational. Alternate locations for the EOC will be communicated to the affected areas. The tracking form should be updated and faxed/delivered at least every 30 minutes as patient evacuation continues. Tracking Forms will be collected and correlated by the Administrative Coordinators supporting the EOC. Note : The Operating Room should use their Evacuation Protocols for triage and movement of patients within the OR. Patient Records, Equipment and Supplies If time and circumstances permit, medications, patient records, personal belongings and equipment and supplies including bedpans, crutches, wheelchairs etc. will be transported with the evacuees if practical. Otherwise, these items will be collected and moved to the new location at the first opportunity. Rapid availability of the patient chart to leave the affected area with the patient will be dependant upon the situation and type of information available. • For all areas: move any readily accessible information with the patient • If time allows, print Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) for the past 24 hours for each patient being evacuated. If immediate evacuation is necessary, the printed information should be limited to the patient summary sheet. • The Pharmacy will print medication lists for the past 24 hours for the evacuated patients. • Radiology will print patient reports for the past 24 hours for the evacuated patients. • If EMR information is limited to the summary sheet, or Pharmacy and/or Radiology are unable to print patient reports, the AOD Boston must be notified. This notification will prompt ISD and Medical Records to facilitate the printing of patient information either on-site if other locations for printing reports are operational, or at a remote location. • Patient information printed in Radiology, Pharmacy, or via ISD and Medical Records will be delivered to the patient location as rapidly as possible. The current locations of evacuated patients will be maintained with the Satellite AOC or designee. Evacuation of Families and Visitors The evacuation of families and visitors is dependent on the situation, and at the discretion of the Position in Charge (PIC). If necessary, the PIC may request additional guidance and support from the Satellite AOC. Consider the following options: • Instruct families to delegate one family member to stay with the patient, while the rest leave the facility and area, if deemed safe to do so. Instruct all other visitors to leave the facility, if it is deemed safe for them to return to their cars and leave the area. • If a Family Area is established, evacuated family members may remain in that area if they choose not to leave, or are unable to do so. Notification of Patient's Relatives not Currently On-Site Relatives will be notified of the patient's new location and general condition as soon as possible. Notification will not interfere with the safety of the patients. If a designated family area is established, communication will occur frequently between the EOC and family area to provide updated information as quickly and efficiently as possible. If a designated family area is not established, the Satellite AOC will identify an alternate location for the coordination of patient family notification. Staffing Resources Depending on the extent and nature of the evacuation, some areas of the facility may not be affected. Available staff from non-affected areas or BCH may be deployed to assist in the area(s) being evacuated or other support areas as needed. To facilitate staffing resources, the Satellite AOC or NAOC [WAL] may request non-affected areas to assess and report the availability of additional staff to the EOC.",
Should I use VNS,"A VNS is a device that stimulates the vagus nerve with electrical impulses. It is used to treat medically refractory epilepsy by sending regular, mild pulses of electrical energy to the brain via the vagus nerve. The VNS does not detetect seizure activity.

What is the staffing plan for the Orthopaedic Clinic in terms of physician availability and interdisciplinary team members?,"We offer an approach to care that puts patients first. The Orthopaedic Clinic is open Monday through Friday. There is a physician on call 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for patient issues. The Orthopaedic interdisciplinary team includes: Orthopedic surgeons, Medical physician specializing in musculoskeletal care, Fellow, Residents, Advance Practice Clinicians (Physician assistants and Nurse practitioners) nurses, physical and occupational therapists and cast technicians.","There is 24 hour a day, 7 days per week coverage available by physicians for patient issues. Nursing staffing plans are arranged to accommodate the specific patient populations, clinic and patient demands.","1. The primary medical/surgical team focuses on early recognition of potential Somatization by ◦ Somatization is considered when there are inconsistencies in the history and/or physical examination, with or without identified psychosocial stressors. ◦ Unusual presentation and course of illness, atypical symptoms, symptoms and impairment out of proportion to findings on physical exam and any available tests and poor response to standard or previously effective treatments are some indications. ◦ SSRD is not a diagnosis of exclusion. It should be a ""rule-in"" diagnosis. Be alert for somatic symptoms that are either very distressing or result in significant disruption of functioning, as well as excessive and disproportionate thoughts, feelings and behaviors regarding those symptoms. ◦ The somatic symptoms may or may not be associated with another general physical condition. 2. Facilitate early interdisciplinary assessment, including Psychiatry Consultation. ◦ Involve consultants from relevant specialties early in the evaluation process. ◦ The admitting attending physician or designee should request Psychiatry Consultation within 24hrs of identifying these concerns, in addition to other medical or surgical consultations that are indicated. Social Work consultation and involvement is also indicated as soon as these cases are identified. ◦ The PCS consultant meets with the patient and family to conduct a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation while the medical assessment is ongoing. ◦ Conduct a thorough but judicious medical work-up 3. Facilitate interdisciplinary provider meeting. ◦ An interdisciplinary team meeting involving the primary medical/surgical service, Psychiatry, SW, Nursing staff and other key consulting services is arranged to review the interdisciplinary findings, discuss the formulation and to achieve consensus on the evaluation, diagnostic impressions and treatment recommendations. 4. Facilitate interdisciplinary meeting informing family of potential diagnosis and intervention in family distress. ◦ After the interdisciplinary meeting of providers, a family/team meeting is arranged to convey diagnostic impressions and treatment recommendations to the patient/family. Discuss the mind-body connection, SSRD diagnosis, and interdisciplinary management plan with the family. ◦ The diagnosis of a SSRD may be difficult to accept and may trigger significant distress (e.g., fear, sadness, guilt and/or anger). Assess family response and address any questions or concerns. Families commonly are fearful of a missed diagnosis and/or feel that their child's symptoms are invalidated, therefore impairing or even severing the working relationship with their caregivers and ultimately impeding treatment. ◦ Families identified to be at high risk require more intensive support and psychoeducation. Regular team meetings, including the PCP, maintain close communication between health care providers and minimize inconsistencies and miscommunications that have the potential to increase the patient/ family mistrust and frustration. When there are protective and/or legal concerns including concern for medical neglect, medical child abuse or pediatric condition falsification, consultation with child protective and legal teams is advised with their participation in the multidisciplinary provider meetings described above. 5. Perform an interdisciplinary management and rehabilitation approach. ◦ An integrated interdisciplinary rehabilitation approach is recommended for SSRD patients with significant functional impairment who require ongoing hospitalization on the medical floor once the diagnosis is established. This includes ongoing psychoeducation about SSRDs, demedicalization of the patient's symptoms and focus on functional improvement. 6. Develop a post-hospitalization management plan. ◦ Discharge planning should be coordinated with early case management involvement. The majority of patients can be managed in the outpatient setting with appropriate mental health follow-up. Scheduled follow up visits with PCP and other specialists are important to maintain alliance and investment in treatment. ◦ Communication with the school is important for a successful transition back and improving overall functioning. Patients with profound and pervasive functional impairment will likely need more intensive treatment such as an admission to a medical-psychiatric partial hospital program or inpatient unit. 7. Process for transfer to the Inpatient Psychiatry Service (IPS). ◦ If considering a medical-psychiatric admission on the IPS as a disposition plan, a referral is made by the PCS to the IPS ◦ A meeting between the IPS team and the family can be facilitated on the medical floor if needed for further review and provision of psychoeducation about the unit. A tour of the unit by the family may also be arranged when appropriate. ◦ In cases where the wait for transfer to the IPS is prolonged (e.g., over a week), weekly multidisciplinary team meetings are recommended to review patient's progress and goals, modify existing treatment plans when indicated and ensure consistent communication across all providers and with the family. ◦ Upon transfer to the IPS, parents/guardians and patients 16yrs or older must execute the standard Massachusetts informed consent to psychiatric hospitalization.","The Department of Orthopaedic Surgery treats patients from newborn to young adulthood in the following clinics: Urgent Care Clinic A daily clinic dedicated to seeing children with injuries and musculoskeletal problems that require prompt evaluation and care Bone And Soft Tissue Tumor Program Provide expertise of BCH and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute for medical and surgical care for children and adolescents with benign or malignant bone and soft tissue tumors Brachial Plexus Program Provide comprehensive care for children with acute and chronic brachial plexus palsies Cerebral Palsy Program Provide interdisciplinary, state-of-the-art evaluation and treatment of children with a variety of neuromuscular conditions including static encephalopathy, progressive neuromuscular conditions and congenital anomalies Child and Young Adult Hip Preservation Program Offer internationally recognized expertise for treating hip disorders in children, adolescents and young adults General Orthopaedic Program Nationally renowned as the preeminent center for the care of children, adolescents and young adults with a wide range of developmental, congenital, neuromuscular and post-traumatic problems of the musculoskeletal system Hand and Orthopedic Upper Extremity Program Provide comprehensive care to infants, children and young adults with a wide range of congenital, neuromuscular, sports-related, traumatic and post-traumatic hand and upper extremity problems Lower Extremity Program Offer comprehensive assessment, diagnosis, non-operative and operative management of complex disorders of the lower extremities Orthopedic Trauma Program The Orthopedic Center works closely with the Trauma Program to provide coordinated care for children with musculoskeletal injuries.

According to the Synergy Professional Model of Care,"Our model of care delivery is the Synergy Model - we match patient/family needs to a nurse's level of expertise. The Synergy Model describes a patient-nurse relationship that supports the primacy of patients and families. All nurse-patient/family assignments are based upon matching patient/family needs to nurse competencies . The Synergy Model describes a cluster of individual characteristics that each patient and family brings to a healthcare situation. These 8 characteristics span a continuum of health to illness and include: stability, complexity, vulnerability, predictability, resiliency, participation in decision-making, participation in care, and resource availability (see Operational Definitions below). Nursing competencies, derived from the needs of patients, are also described in terms of essential continuums. The Synergy Model describes eight dimensions of nursing practice that span the continuum from competent nurse to expert nurse. These include clinical judgment, clinical inquiry, caring practices, response to diversity, advocacy/moral agency, facilitation of learning, collaboration and systems thinking (see Operational Definitions below). These competencies reflect a dynamic integration of knowledge, skills, experience, and attitudes needed to meet patient's needs and optimize patient outcomes. Our professional advancement program is based upon evolving expertise within these eight dimensions of practice.","Within the Synergy Model and consistent with family-centered-care, patients and families are, or assisted to become, active participants in the patient/family-nurse interaction. The interaction is synergistic; specifically, it is reciprocating and co-constituting. The nurse comes to ""know"" the patient and family and the patient and family comes to ""know"" the nurse. When the relationship is in-sync, that is, when it is synergistic then optimal patient outcomes are more apt to occur. Because we believe that excellence in care is provided through meaningful therapeutic relationships with patients and their families, continuity in care is a core element of our model of care. • In support of fostering therapeutic patient/family-nurse relationships, the Charge and Staff Nurses work together to build continuity in nursing care over the patient's illness trajectory by assigning a limited number of nurses to the patient/family. • As colleagues, more experienced nurses mentor less experienced nurses. • Since the needs of patients vary across the system, we have a varying number of Level I, II, and III Staff Nurses and Advanced Practice Nurses who provide varying levels of expertise on each unit to best accommodate patient needs.","Consistent with the rest of Children's Hospital Boston, the Synergy Professional Model of Care guides patient care delivery.

These principles include the characteristics and considerations of the healthcare consumer, the registered nurses, and other inter- professional team members and staff. The staffing plan considers the MFCC patient needs and interventions and the resources required to deliver the necessary level of care to each patient. Other influencing factors include the organizational approach to the delivery of nursing care services and the practice environment on the delivery of care (ANA, 2020). Therapies, services, and activities related to patient care reflect the needs of the patient and their families with consideration for any physical and psychosocial limitations. The principle needs of the patient population influence and determine the competencies required for safe nursing practice on an ongoing basis. Unit and hospital based leadership provide added structure and guidance in the development of competencies which are evaluated on a regular basis. Additionally, the hospital maintains policies, which are also reviewed on a routine basis, that support the needs and safety of patients and nursing staff. The Synergy Professional Model of Care guides patient care delivery. This model of care matches individual nurse competencies and the patient needs when assigning patients. All nursing care meets the requirements of the Massachusetts Nurse Practice Act, American Nurses' Association standards and the standards and policies and procedures set forth by Children's Hospital Boston Department of Nursing. Unit and hospital wide guidelines and protocols for the management of patients are utilized, evaluated and updated on an ongoing basis.",
