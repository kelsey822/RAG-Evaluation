If the screen was not successful, missed, or the infant did not pass prior to the transfer, BCH shall conduct the screen prior to initial discharge to home. b. BCH clinicians must notify the parent(s)/guardian(s) both orally and in writing if a heaing screening was not successful, missed, or the infant did not pass. If a repeat or further screening cannot occur prior to discharge, the parent(s)/guardian(s) should be informed in writing of the inability to test prior to discharge, and the following should occur: i. Notify the infant's primary care provider; and ii. An appointment should be made at a DPH approved screening center such as BCH (note based on lack of availability of appointments at available locations, parents can also be provided with a list of sites that conduct such diagnostic screening for their choice). 3. If an infant cannot be screened due to delayed physiological development or physiological instability (related to but not limited to an illness or premature birth) as determined by the treating clinician, the infant shall be screened prior to discharge and as early as the identified physiological development or stability will permit reliable screening. 4. If the infant is discharged to home prior to conducting the hearing screen, an appointment is made for a screen to be performed within 1 month of the infants birth (note based on lack of availability of appointments at available locations, parents can also be provided with a list of sites that conduct such diagnostic screening for their choice). a. The infant's primary care provider should be notified that a hearing screen is pending. Re-screening 5. The Joint Committee on Infant Hearing (JCIH) recommends a repeat hearing screen prior to discharge for infants with conditions/complications associated with potential hearing loss. a. Conditions that warrant re-screening include, but are not limited to, history of ECMO, bilirubin level >20 and/or hyperbilirubinemia requiring an exchange transfusion, gentamicin dosing>72 hrs, furosemide>7 doses, culture-positive sepsis, and meningitis.\"}",

If the infant will be discharged to another facility, notify the receiving hospital when the most recent specimen was obtained. c.
