This is a data sharing policy for GWAS. The policy establishes a NIH GWAS Repository that has two components: a. An open access portion that will be freely available to the public and will include: i. The protocol ii. Questionnaires iii. Variables measured, and iv. Other supporting documentation b. A controlled access portion that will only be available to researchers who have been approved by an NIH Data Access Committee (DAC). This portion will include: i. Coded phenotype, exposure, genotype and pedigree data 2. What is a Genome Wide Association Study? a. A genome-wide association study is one in which 100,000 or more SNP markers are tested in individual DNA samples. b. NIH also offers the following definition: ""To meet the definition of a GWAS, the density of genetic markers and the extent of linkage disequilibrium should be sufficient to capture (by the r2 parameter) a large proportion of the common variation in the genome of the population under study, and the number of samples (in a case-control or trio design) should provide sufficient power to detect variants of modest effect."" 3. When did the policy go into effect? The GWAS Policy went into effect for competing applications and new proposals submitted on or after January 25, 2008. 4. To whom does the policy apply? The policy applies to investigators who receive any NIH funding for genome-wide analysis of tissue specimens (GWAS). Of note, unlike the NIH data sharing policy that has a threshold of $500,000, the GWAS policy has no threshold – therefore, any NIH funding for GWAS triggers the policy. 5. When is the policy NOT triggered? The policy is not triggered if GWAS is conducted without NIH funds; even if the GWAS use specimens that were collected and/or stored with NIH funding","Complete patient care documentation as described in the Patient Care Manual.

Where is the Mona Lisa displayed,"The Privacy Rule is not intended to impede routine health care communications and practices that are essential in providing health care to individuals including the use of whiteboards. Such practices can continue, even when an incidental use or disclosure may occur, provided that BCH has taken reasonable precautions to safeguard and limit the patient information disclosed. The HIPAA Privacy Rule does not require that all risk of incidental use or disclosure be eliminated to satisfy its standard. Rather, the Rule requires only that organizations implement reasonable safeguards to limit incidental uses or disclosures. An incidental disclosure is one that: • cannot reasonably be prevented, • is limited in nature, and • occurs as a result of an otherwise permitted use or disclosure of patient information. In terms of safeguards to be used, the HIPAA Privacy Rule is not prescriptive, rather advises that each health care organization must evaluate what measures make sense in their environment and tailor their practices and safeguards to their particular circumstances. In determining what is reasonable, organizations should assess potential risks to patient privacy, as well as consider such issues as the potential effects on patient care, and any administrative or financial burden to be incurred from implementing particular safeguards. Organizations also may take into consideration steps that other prudent health care and health information professionals are taking to protect patient privacy.

What is the chemical symbol for gold,"The Chemical Inventory Reconciliation is performed annually, on behalf of the organization, by the Environmental Health and Safety Department. Hazardous Materials storage locations captured within the CISPro electronic chemical inventory program are located within the Enders, Karp, CLS, Fegan, Farley, Hunnewell, Bader, Pavillion, Waltham, Lexington and Peabody locations. Hazardous materials are ordered throughout the year by various areas using a specific approval code within PeopleSoft. These orders are reviewed by the Environmental Health & Safety Department to assure users have the appropriate use and storage locations, waste disposal facilities, training, and other relevant chemical safety parameters before the material is ordered by the supply chain purchase agent. Approved materials are entered into the CISPro database to enable supply chain the ability to create location/bottle specific bar codes which instantaneously updates the chemical inventory upon arrival of the material. Employees are required to remove the CISPro bar codes from chemical containers and affix them to the posted disposal sheets within the laboratory. Environmental Health & Safety provides new disposal bar code sheets within the laboratory, scans discarded bar codes, and updates the system. When a new chemical is introduced or an old chemical is removed that will change the NFPA rating for the room, the Environmental Health and Safety Department adjusts the hazard ratings and updates the NFPA 704 Diamond sign. Completing a Manual Chemical Inventory The process noted below is to be performed by hazardous material users not currently captured within the CISPro inventory program. For example, laboratories moving in after the annual reconciliation, new offsite locations, previously existing spaces now requiring hazardous materials, etc How To Determine if a Chemical is Hazardous Hazard ratings can be found on the chemical label and may appear in numerical form as in the 704 Diamond, or in image form or text form. Information to Include on the Chemical Inventory The chemical inventory should be done in an Excel spreadsheet provided by the Environmental Health and Safety Department. The spreadsheet must include: • Principal Investigator (P.I.), laboratory representative and emergency contact names and off-hours phone number (i.e. home or cell phone number) • Location of where the chemical is kept (i.e. room number, bay number, or flammable cabinet) • Chemical name • CAS # (Chemical Abstract System number) • Physical state (solid or liquid) • New quantity • Brand (i.e. Aldrich, Sigma, VWR) • Any NFPA information if known from MSDSs For Principal Investigators that have more than one laboratory location, a spreadsheet needs to be submitted for each laboratory location, for proper room hazard designation. Example Spreadsheet Set-up: Chemicals have a way of turning up in the least likely locations and therefore, to perform an accurate and complete inventory of the lab, all cabinets, shelves, corners and cubbies must be checked! Take this opportunity to discard any old, out of date or no longer used chemicals. Label these chemicals with a Hazardous Waste label, place them in the Satellite Accumulation Areas and submit a Hazardous Waste Pick-up Request Form . Note: If you discover a chemical that does not look as it should or a container that does not appear to be intact, DO NOT MOVE THE CHEMICAL. Call ext 5-3499; briefly describe the situation, and ask to have the Safety-on-Call person paged. Submitting the Chemical Inventory Spreadsheet Forward the completed Chemical Inventory spreadsheet as an email attachment to the Environmental Health and Safety Department. What will the Chemical Inventories be used for? Environmental Health and Safety will use these inventories to identify the hazard level of each laboratory in the Enders Facility and will update the 704 Diamond sign located on every entrance door to a lab. Copies of the completed inventories will be placed with security for easy access in an emergency. Additionally, any ""4"" ratings will be highlighted for quick reference in an emergency situation. There may be some instances where the label does not identify the contents as hazardous. In this case, refer to the Material Safety Data Sheet for the specific chemical information.

To amend a signed informed consent document, the following should occur: ◦ Draw a single line through the incorrect information without obliterating it and record the correct information above, below, or beside it; ◦ Record the date of the correction (note if you are making the amendment on the same date that the consent was signed, you do NOT need to add in the date); ◦ The primary provider who signed the consent should then sign near the corrected information (note that the designated staff can make the amendment and provide to the primary provider to sign); and ◦ If necessary, the reason for amending the informed consent document and what was changed on the form can be documented in the patient's medical record. • If the provider is not able to have an oral discussion and further have the patient sign the form with the updated information, consider obtaining the approval of the updated information from those individuals who are allowed to consent on behalf of the patient as outlined above. Providers should also be aware of the emergency exceptions for not obtaining consent (even an amendment) based on the guidance outlined below. Note: If there are questions about the need to amend or change any information on an informed consent that is not answered above, please consult the BCH Attorney on Call.","• Only persons trained in classifying, packaging, labeling and documenting Dangerous Goods Class 6 can ship these materials.

When a consent form is translated into another language, the investigator/research team member obtaining consent and the subject/parent should sign on the appropriate signature lines of the translated consent form. In many of these cases an interpreter will also be present to assist in the consent process. 2. The involvement of the qualified interpreter in-person or remotely (e.g. by phone), should be documented with a signed and dated note to file or notation on the consent document. This documentation should be clear. 3. If the investigator/research team speaks the subject's language and is authorized to serve as the interpreter, then documentation, such as a signed and dated note to file or notation on the consent document should be added to clarify this.","1. Providing the consent forms to the subject/family: The PI/research staff should mail/email/fax two copies of the informed consent form for each participant with instructions to contact the Principle Investigator (PI)I/research staff when consents are received. a. Use secure methods to transmit information according to Boston Children's Hospital data security policies. b. There may also be situations when consent forms that need to be signed are posted on websites and families may be instructed how to access them. 2. Reviewing the consent form with the subject/family : Once the participant has a copy of the consent form in front of them, the PI/research staff must review the study and consent document with each participant. a. This should include asking questions to gauge comprehension, and answering a subject's questions and concerns. b. This can be done by phone or videoconference. c. If assent is required, the PI/research staff must have a discussion with both parent/legal guardians and the child participant. 3. Obtaining subject/family signatures : After all questions are answered and the PI/research staff feel confident that each subject/parent/guardian understands the study, then each person needs to sign and date the consent form. a. It is recommended to flag or highlight the correct signature line. b. If there is a separate assent form, ensure the child participant signs, dates, and returns the assent form with the signed parental permission/consent form. 4. Instructions for subjects/families returning the signed consent form to the research team : a. Subjects/families should be instructed to retain one signed copy of the consent form for their own records. b. Whenever possible, the signed consent/assent should be returned to the researcher before a research procedure takes place. i. A consent/assent could be returned by emailing back a scanned PDF or by fax. ii. If this is not possible, a signed copy may be returned by mail at a later date. 5. When subjects/family return the consent/assent form: a. If the PI/research team receives the consent/assent : Once received by the research team, the PI/ research staff should: i. Sign the appropriate signature line ii. Provide the current date of signature (not the date they spoke with participant/parent/guardian). b. If the PI/research team does not receive the consent/assent : If the subject is expected to mail back the signed consent, all attempts need to be made to receive the signed version. i. If the signed copy is not returned, the investigator may need to follow up with the family. The PI/ research staff may need to ask the family to bring the signed consent to the hospital at the time of the next visit. ii. If an investigator does not receive a signed copy, they will not have the informed consent documentation. The research records should clearly document the process and discussion with the family. It is for this reason all attempts must be made to receive a scanned or faxed version before initiating the research and to not rely on families remembering to send it back. 6. Review of all signatures and dates : The PI/research team should ensure all signatures and dates are accurately documented. a. Any errors should be noted in a note or memo. 7. Documentation of the consent process : PI/research staff should document the entire informed consent/assent process for each subject in a memo or related study document. a. Date of PI/research team signature: The PI/research team should specify to whom the study was explained within the PI/research team signor section.

Children with progeria appear normal at birth. Life expectancy is generally to the teen years into the twenties. Death is most often due to sequelae from cardiovascular disease including severe athererosclerosis, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction with aortic stenosis, and eventual heart failure. Cath lab interventions have had limited long term success for these patients, including transapical valve replacements (TAVRs). Left ventricular apex to aortic valved conduits may help these patients live longer and this is where perfusion services can help the surgical team. The valved conduit may go to the ascending aorta or the descending aorta depending on access and calcification of the landing area for the conduit. The surgeon may elect to approach the repair through a left thoracotomy or a median sternotomy. These patients have fragile ribs which are prone to spontaneous fractures. The removal of ribs may be needed during the procedure.","1.

Debriefing is an essential mechanism to enhance interdisciplinary communication about a death and to reduce burnout in providers and rotating trainees. Without debriefing, many team members are left with the feeling that they are alone in their experience of a death. Even a 15 minute debrief can help and set the stage for further conversations and respectful communication between team members. When to debrief, or Why debrief immediately? Scheduling a debriefing for a later date so that everyone who was involved with a death can attend is a very challenging task and often fails to occur. Debriefing immediately does not rule out other debriefings being scheduled later. It can be scheduled before or after bringing child to the morgue but after parents have left the hospital. The neighboring RN or CRN can cover the bedside RN's other patients so that s/he may participate. Who should initiate/lead/attend the debrief? Anyone on the team can (and should) ask for the debrief to be arranged. Generally co-facilitated by fellow or attending and bedside RN, charge RN, or CRN but anyone on the team can lead a debrief (see directions above). The debrief should be multidisciplinary, as perspectives from all of the different disciplines will be helpful and all disciplines can benefit from knowing how the rest of the team is thinking and feeling about the patient and his or her death. Charge nurse, CRN, or bedside nurse should alert RN, RT, CA, clergy, and SW. Fellow/Attending should alert NP's, residents, fellows, and attending. Other services may be invited (General Surgery, Oncology, Neurosurgery, etc.). Where : Conference room, attending office, empty bedspace.","A. Introduction The FDA and other regulatory agencies require that allogeneic cellular therapy donors be fully screened for increased risk for the transmission of relevant diseases. These diseases include infectious (contagious) diseases; and, inherited or other non-infectious acquired conditions. Examples of infectious diseases are hepatitis and syphilis. Examples of non-infectious acquired conditions are lupus and psoriasis. Cellular therapy recipients must be informed if their donor’s screening is incomplete and/or if any disease transmission risks are identified. You are being asked to sign this form because your donor’s screening is considered to be incomplete by FDA standards and/or, because your donor’s risk assessment indicates he or she has an increased risk for the transmission of one or more relevant diseases. This consent form is designed to help you understand the outcome of your donor’s risk assessment and how this could impact your safety. B. Can I receive a product if there are increased risk factors? The outcome of your donor’s risk assessment does not mean that your donor cannot donate or that your donor’s products are unsuitable. With your permission, you will still be able to receive your donor’s cellular therapy product. You are encouraged to ask your physician questions at any time. C. What is the outcome of my donor’s risk assessment for transmissible diseases? Below is a summary of your donor’s risk assessment for disease transmission. 1. Infectious disease risk assessment (one box must be selected)  Your donors risk assessment is complete. Your donor does not have an increased risk for transmitting a relevant infectious disease.  Your donors risk assessment is complete. Your donor has increased risk for Refer to Section D transmitting one or more infectious diseases.  Your donor’s risk assessment status is incomplete. With this status, there may Refer to Section D be increased risk for the transmission of one or more infectious diseases. 2. Inherited and non-infectious acquired disease risk assessment (one box must be selected)  Your donor does not have an increased risk for transmitting an inherited or acquired non-infectious disease.  Your donor has an increased risk for transmitting one or more inherited or Refer to Section E acquired non-infectious diseases. Recipient Information: File in the recipient’s medical record D. Infectious disease transmission risk Your donor’s risk assessment is incomplete and/or indicates increased risk for transmitting one or more infectious diseases for the following reason(s): Infectious disease marker (IDM) testing  One or more infectious disease marker (IDM) tests were not performed at lab Specify IDM(s): facility with specific accreditation and/or using FDA approved test kits and screening is therefore considered to be incomplete. or   Entire Panel*  One or more infectious disease marker (IDM) tests will not be tested within the Specify IDM(s): required timeframe and screening is therefore considered to be incomplete. or   Entire Panel*  One or more infectious disease marker (IDM) tests were not performed and Specify IDM(s): screening is therefore considered to be incomplete.  One or more infectious disease marker (IDM) tests indicated a positive result. Specify IDM(s): *Entire panel includes Chagas, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV1/2, HTLV I/II, Syphilis, and West Nile Virus Health history questionnaire  Your donor provided a positive response to health history question  Chagas regarding travel, exposure, high risk activities, medical diagnosis  Creutzfeld Jacob Disease (“Mad Cow”) and/or treatment which contributes to an increased risk for  Hepatitis B  Hepatitis  HIV  HTLVI,II transmitting:  Malaria  Sepsis/ Bacteremia  Syphilis  Tuberculosis  Vaccinia (Small Pox)  West Nile Virus  Zika Virus  Other:  Your donor was not asked or did not answer one or more health history screening questions and is therefore considered to be incomplete.  Your donor’s health history screening was not performed within a required time frame and is therefore considered to be incomplete. Physical assessment  Your donor’s physical assessment indicates your donor has an increased risk for transmitting the following infectious disease :  Your donor’s physical exam is incomplete or was not performed within a required timeframe and is therefore considered to be incomplete. Review of medical records  Review of your donor’s other medical records (e.g. previous infectious disease testing or past health history questionnaires) indicates your donor has an increased risk for transmitting the following infectious disease :  A review of your donor’s other medical records is incomplete. Recipient Information: File in the recipient’s medical record E. Inherited or non-communicable acquired disease transmission risk Information obtained from your donor’s physical evaluation, health history, and/or medical records review indicates that your donor has an increased risk for transmitting the following inherited or non-infectious acquired disease(s): ______________________________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________________________ F. What are the risks associated with receiving cells from a donor increased risk factors? If your donor was determined to have an increased risk for transmitting a disease, then you have an increased risk(s) for acquiring that disease. Your physician will review the disease transmission risks to you. If any aspect of your donor’s screening assessment was not fully completed, then the extent of your donor’s risk for transmitting a disease to you is not fully known though a disease transmission risk could still be present. Your physician will review the reason for an incomplete assessment and provide you with additional details regarding any known risks. G. Why should I receive a product from a donor if there are increased or unknown risks? Due to the nature of your hematologic disorder and urgent medical need, your transplant doctor has determined that the potential risk of disease transmission from your donor is outweighed by the benefits associated with receiving a cellular therapy product from your donor. It is therefore recommended that you agree to accept a cellular therapy product from your donor as part of your treatment. H. What other options are there? You may elect to not receive a cellular therapy product from this donor. In this case, your transplant team will attempt to identify an alternative suitable donor source. Your decision must be made before your donor begins the donation process and before you begin treatment. Recipient Information: File in the recipient’s medical record I.

Why do leaves change color in the fall,"1. The nurse completes and documents the GRAF-PIF scale to evaluate pediatric inpatients greater than 12 months of age on admission, daily, and when there is a change in patient status that might increase fall risk (e.g., postoperative, change in mental status, change in mobility, addition of medical equipment, new medications or change in health status). ◦ Once patient is determined to be at risk for falls, the patient remains at risk for falls for the remainder of the hospitalization. Focus moves from assessment of risk to implementation of preventative measures. ◦ High fall risk is noted automatically in Powerchart in the Plan of Care under ""precautions"". Note: This scale does not predict accidental falls or those falls resulting from a patient's response to medical treatment. 2. Initiate the following standard fall prevention interventions for all patients regardless of risk. 3. Assess for changes in vital signs, neurological status, pain, and any injuries prior to moving the patient.","Immunizations continue to be one of the most effective preventative health measures. Not only do vaccinations directly benefit the immunized child but they also indirectly benefit unimmunized persons through community immunity. Failure to adhere to the recommended immunization schedules leaves children susceptible to life threatening, vaccine-preventable diseases. There is no evidence of adverse outcomes related to anesthesia and surgery in recently vaccinated children; however, the systemic effects of recent vaccination (e.g. fever, malaise) may be mistaken for pre-op illness or post-op complications.","1.

Relationship with the sponsor or those in trial leadership positions that could be considered reasonably likely to affect their objectivity.","1. Each The staff at Boston Children's Hospital believes in the fair and humane use of behavior management in assisting patients and parents/guardians with the development of alternatives to problematic behaviors. a. Behavior management is based on the theory that consistent, predictable, positive reinforcement of adaptive and safe behaviors motivates children to succeed, increases their coping skills and promotes self-esteem. 2. Unsafe and maladaptive behaviors are decreased or eliminated when a child learns alternative strategies and skills and when adult caregivers are able to empower a child to negotiate and make good choices. 3. Early in the admission, children and parents/guardians are asked how staff may respond to maladaptive behavior or emotional distress should they occur. 4. Patient and parent/guardian preferences are considered and punitive approaches are not used. 5. Protection of patient rights remains a priority in the design and use of behavior plans. 6. Each patient will participate in the creation and development of a Patient Safety and Coping tool. Parents/ guardians will also participate in the Safety Plan's development. The safety Plan will be utilized as a self- assessment tool and will be utilized collaboratively with patient by caregivers as a way to accomplish ongoing safety planning throughout the admission. 7. Individualized behavior management plans (IBP) will be developed by the multidisciplinary treatment team. a. These plans include behavior management interventions to help patients develop the skills needed to assume responsibilities, make living choices, and learn to live in their culture and social group with behaviors that support health, safety and social participation. b. When possible the behavior management plan is developed in collaboration with the patient and parent/guardian. 8. The patient or parent/guardian must consent to the plan before institution. 9. All staff is oriented in the use of behavior management, including variations according to age and cognitive development. 10. Techniques involving corporal punishment, infliction of pain or physical discomfort, or deprivation of food or sleep are prohibited. 11. Restrictive measures may be used only when there is a high risk of or actual occurrence of harm to self or others. a. The use of restraint or seclusion is not included in a plan for Behavioral Management. 12. A copy of the Policy for Behavior Management is given to patients and parents/guardians upon admission. Staff is available 24 hours daily to address questions about the policy or specific patient plan.","1. What applicable requirements exist for sharing individual level data? 2.

Why do we yawn,"We have an obligation to our patients, the government, and third party payers to exercise due diligence, care, and integrity in all that we do—and this includes submitting accurate claims for reimbursement. Our commitment to a strong Billing Compliance Program stems from our effort to ensure that we do all that we can to prevent Fraud, Waste and Abuse. Many laws cover activities like documentation, billing, coding, and relationships between providers. All employees need to be compliant with these laws. 2 Submitting a false claim is a serious offense. Some examples that could lead to a violation are: claiming reimbursement for services that were not performed by the clinician indicated; filing duplicate claims; upcoding to more complex procedures than were actually performed; unbundling; 3 billing for services or items that are not medically necessary; and billing excessive charges. Penalties for violating the False Claims Act include fines between $10,000 and $20,000 per claim , and can potentially include triple damages! It's important to know that the law provides protections for whistleblowers. Anyone may bring a lawsuit on behalf of the government if they have personal knowledge of Fraud, Waste, or Abuse. 4 Our Billing Compliance team works hard to ensure that we remain compliant with every processed and submitted claim. A patient visit involves many people that have an effect on our billing process. We are all responsible to do what we can to ensure we clearly document services and submit accurate claims. This not only has a financial impact on both Boston Children's and the patient; but it actually has a direct impact on quality of care. Employees (including outside consultants) involved in documenting services and submitting claims must maintain personal responsibility; and must raise any questions about the appropriateness or permissibility of any aspect of a claim.","BCH recognizes that staff members who work through an extreme emergency event do so out of dedication to the patients we care for and to the organization. This often comes at personal sacrifice, and as an organization we will recognize extraordinary service during an emergency response as appropriate to the occasion.","As part of our commitment to high reliability, we have defined a process for learning from safety events. All events entered into the SERS system are carefully examined by PPSQ, local leaders and SERS Managers. For the most serious events we use a structured Root Cause Analysis process to develop action items to prevent similar events, not just in a unit or clinic but across the organization. The process we follow is available here and has resulted in a range of specific action items that are complete or underway. Most events do not meet the criteria for review but are learning opportunities, nonetheless. SERS managers along with local leaders should review events that are filed in their area to understand potential opportunities to prevent errors and eliminate harm.","We at BCH are deeply committed to our Compliance Program. The reputation of BCH rests in the hands of the employees and our commitment to honesty, fairness and compliance with all the laws both federal and state and the method in which we do business. We at BCH believe that our business conduct and our relationships with each other, our patients, our vendors and all others with whom we do business should always be governed by the utmost lawful and ethical standards. In addition, BCH requires that all vendors review our Corporate Compliance Plan and Code of Conduct. Each new vendor is screened through the Office of the Inspector General's and General Services Administration's databases Sanctioned Providers, prior to doing business with BCH. BCH will NOT conduct any business with any person excluded or sanctioned from participating in Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally funded programs.

This includes drugs used for non-survival procedures. In certain cases, the IACUC may approve the use of non-pharmaceutical- grade compounds, if scientifically justified by the investigator. Justification must include a discussion of: • Why a pharmaceutical-grade compound cannot be used (e.g., non-availability of a veterinary or human pharmaceutical-grade product; pharmaceutical grade agents are not the correct concentration and/or formulation). Cost savings alone is not an acceptable justification. • Investigators may also provide a reference to support that no adverse events are expected based on the non-pharmaceutical grade nature of the agent. For all non-pharmaceutical grade agents, investigators must ensure that pH, purity, stability, and sterility concerns are addressed.","Why debrief? Debriefing is an essential mechanism to enhance interdisciplinary communication about a death and to reduce burnout in providers and rotating trainees. Without debriefing, many team members are left with the feeling that they are alone in their experience of a death. Even a 15 minute debrief can help and set the stage for further conversations and respectful communication between team members. When to debrief, or Why debrief immediately? Scheduling a debriefing for a later date so that everyone who was involved with a death can attend is a very challenging task and often fails to occur. Debriefing immediately does not rule out other debriefings being scheduled later. It can be scheduled before or after bringing child to the morgue but after parents have left the hospital. The neighboring RN or CRN can cover the bedside RN's other patients so that s/he may participate. Who should initiate/lead/attend the debrief? Anyone on the team can (and should) ask for the debrief to be arranged. Generally co-facilitated by fellow or attending and bedside RN, charge RN, or CRN but anyone on the team can lead a debrief (see directions above). The debrief should be multidisciplinary, as perspectives from all of the different disciplines will be helpful and all disciplines can benefit from knowing how the rest of the team is thinking and feeling about the patient and his or her death. Charge nurse, CRN, or bedside nurse should alert RN, RT, CA, clergy, and SW. Fellow/Attending should alert NP's, residents, fellows, and attending. Other services may be invited (General Surgery, Oncology, Neurosurgery, etc.). Where : Conference room, attending office, empty bedspace.","1.

Such treatment may be offered to detainees or prisoners of war with their informed consent when the medical products are subject to FDA regulations, and only when the same product may be available to DoD- affiliated personnel consistent with established medical practices. 3. The IRB is aware of the definition of ""prisoner of war"" for the DoD component granting the addendum.","DSMBs/DMCs are typically made up of individuals who: 1. Have expertise in the field 2. Experience in the conduct of clinical trials 3. Statistical knowledge 4. Who do not have any conflicts of interest, such as: a. Financial interests that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the trial b. Strong views on the relative merits of the interventions under study, c. Relationship with the sponsor or those in trial leadership positions that could be considered reasonably likely to affect their objectivity.","A protocol submission to the IRB must establish the level of decision-making ability necessary to consent. This determination is based on the level of risk that the subject will be exposed to, with higher risk protocols requiring a greater level of understanding. Furthermore, the protocol must describe in detail: 1. How competency will be assessed 2. Who will be performing the assessments, and what that professional's relationship is to the individual and the research team.","The protocol application and informed consent should describe in detail: 1.

Investigators are responsible, on a per protocol basis, for designating appropriate individuals to obtain consent for a protocol. It is also the investigator's responsibility to train, oversee, and monitor all individuals who obtain consent on his or her protocol. 2. Individuals other than the investigator may obtain consent; however, any individual who obtains consent must be listed on the protocol application as having this role. 3. Only members of the research team who have experience in all elements of the study may provide a complete and accurate description of the research, and answer questions and concerns. 4. Even when responsibilities for obtaining informed consent are delegated, the investigator always remains responsible for assuring an adequate process to obtain informed consent. Special considerations include the technicality of the details of the protocol, and who can best explain them. For example, research that involves the use of an investigational drug will likely require that a physician member of the research team obtain informed consent. 5. Who is best able to answer the questions that may come up? It may be advantageous to have two individuals involved in the consent process. 6. Often the investigator provides information, and a research nurse is made available to follow-up and provide additional information. 7.

This includes drugs used for non-survival procedures. In certain cases, the IACUC may approve the use of non-pharmaceutical- grade compounds, if scientifically justified by the investigator. Justification must include a discussion of: • Why a pharmaceutical-grade compound cannot be used (e.g., non-availability of a veterinary or human pharmaceutical-grade product; pharmaceutical grade agents are not the correct concentration and/or formulation). Cost savings alone is not an acceptable justification. • Investigators may also provide a reference to support that no adverse events are expected based on the non-pharmaceutical grade nature of the agent. For all non-pharmaceutical grade agents, investigators must ensure that pH, purity, stability, and sterility concerns are addressed.","Q: How do I cancel a removal in BoxPicker?

What is the process by which plants make their own food called,"Species Covered: All Vertebrate Species Before many animals are subjected to anesthesia, their food intake must be restricted and their overall health carefully monitored in order to avoid certain potentially dangerous complications during and/or after the procedure. 1. Prior to performing surgery and/or administering anesthesia, all food should be withheld from subject animals for a period of time. The period of time during which food should be withheld depends upon the species of the animal and the procedure. 2. A distended stomach could interfere with free movement of the animal's diaphragm and impede its breathing. A full stomach predisposes the animal to vomiting under anesthesia and possible inhalation of vomitus. This may cause aspiration pneumonia, which may be fatal. In ruminants, a short fasting period will not empty the rumen, but it will decrease the rate of fermentation and therefore reduce bloat when rumination is suppressed during anesthesia. 3. Withholding of Food a. The following guidelines are generally used for the species listed below. The ARCH veterinary staff may make specific recommendations for a species, depending on the procedure that the animal will undergo. Species Length of Fast Sheep 24-48 hours Swine overnight Dogs overnight Rabbits for abdominal surgery, overnight Rodent generally not fasted Amphibians overnight Fish overnight b. The withholding of food prior to a procedure must be coordinated with the ARCH veterinary staff. Special care (NPO) cards must be placed on the cage at the time food is removed. c. If an animal is fasted in preparation for a procedure, and the procedure is cancelled on the day that it was scheduled, the animal must be given access to food. 4. Withholding of Water a. Water is generally not withheld prior to a procedure. Animals are given ad lib access to water, unless specific recommendations are made by the ARCH Veterinary staff. b. Although rarely done, water may be withheld from sheep for twelve (12) hours prior to anesthesia for a major surgical procedure","This policy helps to maintain safe food and practices for patients and patient families who bring their own food for storage at the hospital.

MOLST Medical Orders for Life MOLST (Medical Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment) describes Sustaining Treatment the decisions made regarding advance care planning. Completing a MOLST form is appropriate for patients with advancing illness due to a serious medical condition. Completing a MOLST form requires a collaborative decision making process which takes into consideration the patient's medical condition, the patient's or patient representatives goals and values, and recommendations from the care team. Please note that the Massachusetts Department of Public Health has approved the use of a MOLST as a standard medical order that should be considered as part of a patient's recommended care and treatment.

Patient Competent individual over the age of 18 years or an emancipated/ mature minor Patient Representative The patient representative is an individual who has authority to make medical decisions for a patient who, due to mental/physical incapacity or age is unable or unavailable to make his/her own decisions. A patient representative may be: A parent or guardian if the patient is under the age of 18 years, A court-appointed guardian with authority to make health care decisions for the patient, or A patient's legal representative such as a health-care agent (proxy) or a health-care power of attorney.","• Emancipated Minor: ◦ A minor is considered ""Emancipated"" to be able to make their own decisions if they have obtained a court order to end the rights and responsibilities of the parents ◦ It is important to note that the court order can grant either : (1) a ""Partial Emancipation"" to allow the minor to make decisions about themselves, but still be entitled to financial support from the parents (most common); or (2) ""Complete Emancipation"" to allow minor to make any decision about themselves (NOT common) • Mature Minor: ◦ Regardless of emancipation, a minor may also be determined to be a ""mature minor"" who can consent to their own health care without parental involvement or consent, only under the following circumstances: ▪ Married, widowed, or divorced; ▪ Pregnant or believes herself to be pregnant; ▪ A parent of a child (he/she may also give consent for the medical/dental care of the child); ▪ Enlisted in the military on a full-time active duty basis; ▪ Living separate and apart from parents or a legal guardian and is managing their own financial affairs; ▪ Reasonably believes they have contracted a disease dangerous to the public health, and they seek treatment for such disease; ▪ Seeking their own treatment for: drug addiction (provided that they are at least 12 years old and two or more physicians determined the child is drug dependent), family planning services, or treatment for sexually transmitted diseases (including HIV or AIDS); or ▪ Seeking to voluntarily commit themselves for mental health treatment without parental consent (provided they are at least 16 years of age). ◦ The last three criteria do not confer mature minor status to pre-op patients (e.g. a patient < 18 years old cannot provide surgical consent simply because they have sought their own treatment for drug addiction) ◦ No documentation is required to prove that a patient is a mature minor ◦ Consents by a mature minor are confidential ▪ Parent/guardians should not be informed about the procedure unless: (1) the provider reasonably believes that the minor's condition is dangerous to life or limb; or (2) the minor agrees. Such agreements must be documented in the patient's medical record. If the mature minor's parent and/or guardian is not notified, make sure that the finance office is also notified, so confidentiality is maintained and special payment arrangements are put into place if necessary.","• Decision-making about life-sustaining treatment is considered a shared responsibility between the health care team and the family, which is consistent with Children's Hospital Boston's (CHB) philosophy of family-centered patient care. • In general, parents have the responsibility to make health care decisions for their minor children. • Adult patients have the responsibility to make their own decisions regarding life-sustaining treatments unless they are deemed incompetent to do so. • Children and adolescents who have attained a sufficient cognitive and developmental level to understand and evaluate their treatment options are generally given substantial consideration in the decision-making process. ◦ Note: For more information, see the related content listed below. • Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is initiated in the event of sudden or impending death unless there is a properly executed Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) Order to the contrary.",0,0,0,0,0

Why do we dream,"As part of our commitment to high reliability, we have defined a process for learning from safety events. All events entered into the SERS system are carefully examined by PPSQ, local leaders and SERS Managers. For the most serious events we use a structured Root Cause Analysis process to develop action items to prevent similar events, not just in a unit or clinic but across the organization. The process we follow is available here and has resulted in a range of specific action items that are complete or underway. Most events do not meet the criteria for review but are learning opportunities, nonetheless. SERS managers along with local leaders should review events that are filed in their area to understand potential opportunities to prevent errors and eliminate harm.","We at BCH are deeply committed to our Compliance Program. The reputation of BCH rests in the hands of the employees and our commitment to honesty, fairness and compliance with all the laws both federal and state and the method in which we do business. We at BCH believe that our business conduct and our relationships with each other, our patients, our vendors and all others with whom we do business should always be governed by the utmost lawful and ethical standards. In addition, BCH requires that all vendors review our Corporate Compliance Plan and Code of Conduct. Each new vendor is screened through the Office of the Inspector General's and General Services Administration's databases Sanctioned Providers, prior to doing business with BCH. BCH will NOT conduct any business with any person excluded or sanctioned from participating in Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally funded programs. Everyone who does business with BCH deserves to be treated honestly and fairly.","We have an obligation to our patients, the government, and third party payers to exercise due diligence, care, and integrity in all that we do—and this includes submitting accurate claims for reimbursement. Our commitment to a strong Billing Compliance Program stems from our effort to ensure that we do all that we can to prevent Fraud, Waste and Abuse. Many laws cover activities like documentation, billing, coding, and relationships between providers. All employees need to be compliant with these laws. 2 Submitting a false claim is a serious offense. Some examples that could lead to a violation are: claiming reimbursement for services that were not performed by the clinician indicated; filing duplicate claims; upcoding to more complex procedures than were actually performed; unbundling; 3 billing for services or items that are not medically necessary; and billing excessive charges. Penalties for violating the False Claims Act include fines between $10,000 and $20,000 per claim , and can potentially include triple damages! It's important to know that the law provides protections for whistleblowers. Anyone may bring a lawsuit on behalf of the government if they have personal knowledge of Fraud, Waste, or Abuse. 4 Our Billing Compliance team works hard to ensure that we remain compliant with every processed and submitted claim. A patient visit involves many people that have an effect on our billing process. We are all responsible to do what we can to ensure we clearly document services and submit accurate claims. This not only has a financial impact on both Boston Children's and the patient; but it actually has a direct impact on quality of care. Employees (including outside consultants) involved in documenting services and submitting claims must maintain personal responsibility; and must raise any questions about the appropriateness or permissibility of any aspect of a claim.","BCH recognizes that staff members who work through an extreme emergency event do so out of dedication to the patients we care for and to the organization.

Who wrote the Harry Potter series,"1. Discuss with the team the plan for confirming acirculation (pulselessness). If the patient does not have an arterial line and one is not going to be placed or the current a line reading is questionable, confirm that an echocardiography attending and echo machine will be present in the OR. 2. Heparin (300 u/kg) will be administered to the patient when he/she becomes hypotensive (MAP<50 mmHg for patients over 10 years old, MAP<40 mmHg for patients 1-10 years old, MAP<30 for patients less than 1 year old). 3. If time permits, one ICU nurse should go down to OR ""A"" and check that it's set up as expected (suction, second bed if the family wants, rocking chairs, tissues, music, sheets covering equipment to make it look less OR-like, bed near plug or with extension cord). 4. An OR nurse meets the family on the unit and accompanies the patient, family and team to the OR. 5. Prior to transfer to the OR, huddle with the care team and NEOB to discuss: ◦ Roles, specifically: i. Who will give medications, including heparin, how, and dose ii. Who will talk with the family in the OR to describe the OR layout and personnel and remind them of the order of events while the team is getting the patient set up in the room. iii. Who will accompany the family when they leave the room and who will update the family after the donation; where will the family be located. ◦ Which clock will be used, insure synchronization 6. The patient remains in the care of the ICU team until the patient is transferred to the second OR for organ donation and then again after donation if family wishes to see the child after organ recovery is completed. 7.

This emergency can cause blood contamination, hemolysis, septic shock, organ failure, air embolism and death. Terumo Capiox FX series guidelines state that leaks may occur at water pressures greater than 28 PSI at the inlet of the heat exchanger (4). Sorin series oxygenators specify leaks may occur at water pressures greater than 29 PSI at the inlet of the heat exchanger (5). To check for leaks, connect water lines to the heat exchanger and circulating for at least five minutes. Despite the routine use of a water leak test, documented cases of heat exchanger leak have occurred (6-7). The perfusionist must be able to recognize and respond appropriately to this emergency situation (8). The wall water system and the Hemotherm use positive pressure to circulate the water. In the event of a heat exchanger leak, it is unlikely to see blood in the water lines. If a heat exchanger leak is detected, the oxygenator should be changed out (refer to 4.1 Failure to Oxygenate Blood/Oxygenator Changeout).","1. Purpose: To describe the use of an oxygenator in series with a ventricular assist device. 2. The insertion of a Quadrox-iD Adult oxygenator in series with a ventricular assist device (VAD) is an alternative to supplementing gas exchange in patients with VADs who have severe refractory respiratory failure. The VAD will pump blood through the oxygenator. If BiVAD is being used the oxygenator is inserted into the right sided device. a. The insertion of a Quadrox-iD Adult oxygenator into a VAD (typically an Abiomed) is considered when the patient is refractory to maximized mechanical ventilator support. b. The decision to add an oxygenator to a VAD is approved by both a CICU Attending and Cardiac Surgery Attending. c.

What is the largest species of bear,"The following IRB guidelines for pregnancy testing are implemented as part of a research protocol: 1. An investigator's plan for pregnancy testing is to be consistent with the clinical guidelines unless a justified exception is approved by the IRB and the Department Chair or Division Chief. 2. Protocols may not exclude persons based upon their potential to bear children. There must be justified, scientific rationale to exclude persons of childbearing potential. 3. Massachusetts law requires that a positive pregnancy test result be communicated only to the minor and not to their parents without permission. This includes pregnancy test results obtained during the course of research. 4. The IRB sets an age criterion of 12 years or the onset of menses, as a requirement for pregnancy testing in protocols that may potentially affect a fetus. a. If an investigator proposes to perform pregnancy testing for children under the age of 12 or before the onset of menses, the investigator must justify why this is appropriate for the protocol. b. In determining whether it is acceptable to perform pregnancy testing before age 12 or the onset of menses, the IRB considers the potential for direct benefit offered by the protocol within the context of the research. 5. Adolescents under the age of 12 : For subjects under the age of 12 (if required by the protocol), the investigator is to use their discretion as to the subject's knowledge of and exposure to sexual activities in order to determine whether a separate document is reasonable. 6. Adolescents age 12 and older : The IRB strongly recommends that investigators consider the use of a separate document for adolescents age 12 and older, even when assent is not required by the adolescent. This document is to address pregnancy testing and the need to avoid pregnancy only. 7. Any plan for pregnancy testing must be fully disclosed in the informed consent document. The consent is to include: a. The type of pregnancy testing (blood or urine). b. The frequency of testing (prior to the trial, during, both). c. What will happen if results are positive? d.

(Dialysis Unit) Electronic Medical Record The lab documents the bacteriology and dialysate culture results here. (Patient RDU) Results are displayed by month and year.,"The Chemical Inventory Reconciliation is performed annually, on behalf of the organization, by the Environmental Health and Safety Department. Hazardous Materials storage locations captured within the CISPro electronic chemical inventory program are located within the Enders, Karp, CLS, Fegan, Farley, Hunnewell, Bader, Pavillion, Waltham, Lexington and Peabody locations. Hazardous materials are ordered throughout the year by various areas using a specific approval code within PeopleSoft. These orders are reviewed by the Environmental Health & Safety Department to assure users have the appropriate use and storage locations, waste disposal facilities, training, and other relevant chemical safety parameters before the material is ordered by the supply chain purchase agent. Approved materials are entered into the CISPro database to enable supply chain the ability to create location/bottle specific bar codes which instantaneously updates the chemical inventory upon arrival of the material. Employees are required to remove the CISPro bar codes from chemical containers and affix them to the posted disposal sheets within the laboratory. Environmental Health & Safety provides new disposal bar code sheets within the laboratory, scans discarded bar codes, and updates the system. When a new chemical is introduced or an old chemical is removed that will change the NFPA rating for the room, the Environmental Health and Safety Department adjusts the hazard ratings and updates the NFPA 704 Diamond sign. Completing a Manual Chemical Inventory The process noted below is to be performed by hazardous material users not currently captured within the CISPro inventory program. For example, laboratories moving in after the annual reconciliation, new offsite locations, previously existing spaces now requiring hazardous materials, etc How To Determine if a Chemical is Hazardous Hazard ratings can be found on the chemical label and may appear in numerical form as in the 704 Diamond, or in image form or text form. Information to Include on the Chemical Inventory The chemical inventory should be done in an Excel spreadsheet provided by the Environmental Health and Safety Department. The spreadsheet must include: • Principal Investigator (P.I.), laboratory representative and emergency contact names and off-hours phone number (i.e. home or cell phone number) • Location of where the chemical is kept (i.e. room number, bay number, or flammable cabinet) • Chemical name • CAS # (Chemical Abstract System number) • Physical state (solid or liquid) • New quantity • Brand (i.e. Aldrich, Sigma, VWR) • Any NFPA information if known from MSDSs For Principal Investigators that have more than one laboratory location, a spreadsheet needs to be submitted for each laboratory location, for proper room hazard designation. Example Spreadsheet Set-up: Chemicals have a way of turning up in the least likely locations and therefore, to perform an accurate and complete inventory of the lab, all cabinets, shelves, corners and cubbies must be checked! Take this opportunity to discard any old, out of date or no longer used chemicals. Label these chemicals with a Hazardous Waste label, place them in the Satellite Accumulation Areas and submit a Hazardous Waste Pick-up Request Form . Note: If you discover a chemical that does not look as it should or a container that does not appear to be intact, DO NOT MOVE THE CHEMICAL. Call ext 5-3499; briefly describe the situation, and ask to have the Safety-on-Call person paged. Submitting the Chemical Inventory Spreadsheet Forward the completed Chemical Inventory spreadsheet as an email attachment to the Environmental Health and Safety Department. What will the Chemical Inventories be used for? Environmental Health and Safety will use these inventories to identify the hazard level of each laboratory in the Enders Facility and will update the 704 Diamond sign located on every entrance door to a lab. Copies of the completed inventories will be placed with security for easy access in an emergency. Additionally, any ""4"" ratings will be highlighted for quick reference in an emergency situation. There may be some instances where the label does not identify the contents as hazardous. In this case, refer to the Material Safety Data Sheet for the specific chemical information.

Why do birds sing,"• Obtain a reclining chair and provide privacy as able for the parent/infant. • Parent should expose chest skin (unbutton shirt or remove clothing) to perform skin to skin. Offer a blanket cover to parent. • Infant should be dressed only in a diaper, consider use of hats and socks as indicated. Infant is placed in an upright position against the parent's chest. This requires two caregivers for infants on respiratory support or with IV lines. It may be less disruptive to perform a standing transfer where parent stands to receive the infant and then sits in chair. • Infant should be placed in a prone position on parent's bare chest with shoulders flat against parent and arms and legs in flexed positioning. Head should be turned to one side with neck/spine straight and not bent. Nose and mouth should not be covered. • Cover baby and parent with a blanket. • Infant should remain on cardiac monitor and oximetry at all times, unless otherwise ordered. • Assess temperature stability with axillary temperature measurement. Temperature should be recorded in vital signs section on PowerChart. ◦ Check temperature prior to STS and 15 minutes into session, and then check every 60 minutes. • STS care should be discontinued if the infant becomes unstable (e.g. respiratory distress, increased apnea or desaturation, temperature instability, etc.) • Encourage parents to sing or talk softly to infant during STS. Parents should be educated to not fall asleep during STS session due to infant fall risk. Discourage use of electronics or cellphone during STS Care due to infant fall risk and interrupted bonding. • Encourage lactating mothers to pump their breasts after a STS session.

What is the square root of 64,"Estimated Weight Weight estimated by physical observation or report of parent/guardian in an emergent or critical situation when a measured weight cannot be obtained. Measured Weight The numeric value obtained when measured on an age appropriate scale following procedure guidelines. Weight for The weight used for dosing medications and other calculations (may be Calculation adjusted, dry or measured weight) . Measured Height/ The measured height using stadiometer andlength using length board Length Height for The height used for dosing medications and other calculations (usually the Calculation same as measured height/length) . Body Mass Index A weight-to-height ratio, calculated by dividing one's weight in kilograms by the (BMI) square of one's height in meters. Body Surface The square root of product of the weight in kg times the height in cm divided by Area (BSA) 3600.","1. Equipment: Aortic root needles (14 long, 18 short and long), tourniquets, connector for aortic root needle, (3) 60ml syringes (to acquire heart donor blood for cardioplegia), (3-4) bags of cardioplegia from Pumproom refrigerator (1-2 for cardioplegia delivery, 1 for storage/transport, 1 for backup) 2. Fill transport cooler half to 2/3 full of ice from ice machine located across from the Pumproom. 3. The New England Organ Bank (NEOB) organizes the timing of the procedure. The procurement physician should contact the attending transplant surgeon: before takeoff, upon arrival at the donor facility, after acceptance of the organ, after cross clamping, before takeoff for the return trip and upon landing in Boston (or at similar times if traveling by ground).","1. Delivery is initiated with the surgeon or assistant moving the clamp on the table lines from the outlet to the return limb. 2. Flow is controlled at the heart-lung machine by the perfusionist. 3. We generally give the 20 ml/Kg cardioplegia dose over 1-2 minutes with a system pressure of 100-200 mmHg. Lower system pressures are common with neonates (especially with Dr. del Nido). Cardioplegia flow for all methods is adjusted from the initial flow based on the surgeon's observation of the heart and electrical activity. 1. Initial pressure with neonates 50-80 mmHg and adjusted per discussion with the surgeon. 2. Initial pressure with infants 80-100 mmHg and adjusted per discussion with the surgeon. 3. Initial pressure with all other patients 100-200 mmHg and adjusted per discussion with the surgeon. 4. The initial flow rate for root administration is limited to 300 ml/minute in larger patients. 5. The initial flow rate for ostial administration can be classified as ""barely on"" and is adjusted per discussion with the surgeon. 4. We do not monitor aortic root pressure although the surgeon monitors aortic root distention closely during delivery to prevent capillary damage from high shear forces with too rapid a delivery. 5. Our method often results in a cardioplegia delivery flow rate of 10-20 ml/Kg/min. It is clinically rather simple to estimate the initial delivery rate by taking half of the arresting dose volume and using that as the flow rate. For example, in a 12 Kg patient, the dose volume would be 240 ml (20 ml/Kg cardioplegia x 12 kg). An initial infusion rate of half that (120 ml/minute) would be a proper estimate to achieve an infusion rate of 1-2 minutes. 6. Cardioplegia system pressures may be higher with increased flows, smaller root needles, and ostial delivery. These higher system pressures are not linearly related to root pressure but it is still imperative that the surgeon visually monitor delivery. 7. Ensure post administration clamping of outlet limb for recirculation (and cooling) with verbal confirmation and visual inspection of the reservoir bag to make sure the bag is not losing volume.","1.

When did the Cold War end,Dry Decontamination enables immediate access and rapid deployment of decontamination supplies if wet decontamination is not available. Dry Decontamination does not require water and may be used in any scenario in which the use of water may cause delays or increase risk for patients or responders. The following are several scenarios in which dry decontamination may be considered appropriate: Patient Volume • A large or small influx of contaminated patients prior to setup of decontamination showers and/or tent. • Code Orange Plan activation occurs when the hospital is experiencing high patient volume and there is a need for timely decontamination before treatment. Cold Weather • Consider use when ambient temperature is between 65°F and 35°F to minimize the risk of hypothermia. Delayed or No Access to Facility Water • Use dry decon to begin decontamination procedures when wet decontamination set-up is delayed or in progress. • When facility or city infrastructure is unable to provide water to the decontamination showers.,"• Cold chain is a temperature-controlled supply chain. An unbroken cold chain is an uninterrupted series of storage and distribution activities which maintain a given temperature range. It is used to help extend and ensure the shelf life of products such as fresh agricultural produce, seafood, frozen food, photographic film, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. Such products, during transport and when in transient storage, are called cool cargo. Unlike other goods or merchandise, cold chain goods are perishable and always en route towards end use or destination, even when held temporarily in cold stores and hence commonly referred to as cargo during its entire logistics cycle. • Undue delay refers to a situation where a patient waits longer than anticipated to receive a prescribed medication.","• To ensure every patient leaves the hospital feeling that someone listened to them, did not add further to their stress and did their best (within the limitations of our system) to help address their needs • To lessen the potential negative impact of a late arrival on patient, family, and provider experience.","Prior to decontaminating patients, the ambulance bay must be set up properly to ensure responder safety and limit the risk of further contamination of the area. Hot, Warm, and Cold Zones should be established. See Small Scale Decon Guide and Large Scale Setup with Zumro Tent . Decontamination involves removal of all clothing/jewelry/wearables and thorough washing of the patient to remove contaminants.

What is the chemical symbol for silver,"The Chemical Inventory Reconciliation is performed annually, on behalf of the organization, by the Environmental Health and Safety Department. Hazardous Materials storage locations captured within the CISPro electronic chemical inventory program are located within the Enders, Karp, CLS, Fegan, Farley, Hunnewell, Bader, Pavillion, Waltham, Lexington and Peabody locations. Hazardous materials are ordered throughout the year by various areas using a specific approval code within PeopleSoft. These orders are reviewed by the Environmental Health & Safety Department to assure users have the appropriate use and storage locations, waste disposal facilities, training, and other relevant chemical safety parameters before the material is ordered by the supply chain purchase agent. Approved materials are entered into the CISPro database to enable supply chain the ability to create location/bottle specific bar codes which instantaneously updates the chemical inventory upon arrival of the material. Employees are required to remove the CISPro bar codes from chemical containers and affix them to the posted disposal sheets within the laboratory. Environmental Health & Safety provides new disposal bar code sheets within the laboratory, scans discarded bar codes, and updates the system. When a new chemical is introduced or an old chemical is removed that will change the NFPA rating for the room, the Environmental Health and Safety Department adjusts the hazard ratings and updates the NFPA 704 Diamond sign. Completing a Manual Chemical Inventory The process noted below is to be performed by hazardous material users not currently captured within the CISPro inventory program. For example, laboratories moving in after the annual reconciliation, new offsite locations, previously existing spaces now requiring hazardous materials, etc How To Determine if a Chemical is Hazardous Hazard ratings can be found on the chemical label and may appear in numerical form as in the 704 Diamond, or in image form or text form. Information to Include on the Chemical Inventory The chemical inventory should be done in an Excel spreadsheet provided by the Environmental Health and Safety Department. The spreadsheet must include: • Principal Investigator (P.I.), laboratory representative and emergency contact names and off-hours phone number (i.e. home or cell phone number) • Location of where the chemical is kept (i.e. room number, bay number, or flammable cabinet) • Chemical name • CAS # (Chemical Abstract System number) • Physical state (solid or liquid) • New quantity • Brand (i.e. Aldrich, Sigma, VWR) • Any NFPA information if known from MSDSs For Principal Investigators that have more than one laboratory location, a spreadsheet needs to be submitted for each laboratory location, for proper room hazard designation. Example Spreadsheet Set-up: Chemicals have a way of turning up in the least likely locations and therefore, to perform an accurate and complete inventory of the lab, all cabinets, shelves, corners and cubbies must be checked! Take this opportunity to discard any old, out of date or no longer used chemicals. Label these chemicals with a Hazardous Waste label, place them in the Satellite Accumulation Areas and submit a Hazardous Waste Pick-up Request Form . Note: If you discover a chemical that does not look as it should or a container that does not appear to be intact, DO NOT MOVE THE CHEMICAL. Call ext 5-3499; briefly describe the situation, and ask to have the Safety-on-Call person paged. Submitting the Chemical Inventory Spreadsheet Forward the completed Chemical Inventory spreadsheet as an email attachment to the Environmental Health and Safety Department. What will the Chemical Inventories be used for? Environmental Health and Safety will use these inventories to identify the hazard level of each laboratory in the Enders Facility and will update the 704 Diamond sign located on every entrance door to a lab. Copies of the completed inventories will be placed with security for easy access in an emergency. Additionally, any ""4"" ratings will be highlighted for quick reference in an emergency situation. There may be some instances where the label does not identify the contents as hazardous. In this case, refer to the Material Safety Data Sheet for the specific chemical information.

Why do we have leap years,"We have an obligation to our patients, the government, and third party payers to exercise due diligence, care, and integrity in all that we do—and this includes submitting accurate claims for reimbursement. Our commitment to a strong Billing Compliance Program stems from our effort to ensure that we do all that we can to prevent Fraud, Waste and Abuse. Many laws cover activities like documentation, billing, coding, and relationships between providers. All employees need to be compliant with these laws. 2 Submitting a false claim is a serious offense. Some examples that could lead to a violation are: claiming reimbursement for services that were not performed by the clinician indicated; filing duplicate claims; upcoding to more complex procedures than were actually performed; unbundling; 3 billing for services or items that are not medically necessary; and billing excessive charges. Penalties for violating the False Claims Act include fines between $10,000 and $20,000 per claim , and can potentially include triple damages! It's important to know that the law provides protections for whistleblowers. Anyone may bring a lawsuit on behalf of the government if they have personal knowledge of Fraud, Waste, or Abuse. 4 Our Billing Compliance team works hard to ensure that we remain compliant with every processed and submitted claim. A patient visit involves many people that have an effect on our billing process. We are all responsible to do what we can to ensure we clearly document services and submit accurate claims. This not only has a financial impact on both Boston Children's and the patient; but it actually has a direct impact on quality of care. Employees (including outside consultants) involved in documenting services and submitting claims must maintain personal responsibility; and must raise any questions about the appropriateness or permissibility of any aspect of a claim.","As part of our commitment to high reliability, we have defined a process for learning from safety events. All events entered into the SERS system are carefully examined by PPSQ, local leaders and SERS Managers. For the most serious events we use a structured Root Cause Analysis process to develop action items to prevent similar events, not just in a unit or clinic but across the organization. The process we follow is available here and has resulted in a range of specific action items that are complete or underway. Most events do not meet the criteria for review but are learning opportunities, nonetheless. SERS managers along with local leaders should review events that are filed in their area to understand potential opportunities to prevent errors and eliminate harm.",1.

Note: Any alcohol discovered in the Enders, KARP or CLSB Research buildings also requires a notification of the RAOC, (Research Administrator on Call).","To provide for the coordination of hospital and community resources during an emergency response, BCH has adopted the Hospital Incident Command System which has been modified to fit the unique operational structure of the organization while maintaining the overall structure and naming conventions set forth by National Incident Management System (NIMS). This scalable command structure is based on an ""all hazards"" approach. Its primary purpose is to provide administrative command and control (i.e. coordination and support) for all hospital resources dedicated to the response effort and to establish effective communication and coordination with external response agencies to facilitate the maintenance of hospital operations. BCH uses a single HICS model to support all satellite locations. Through the use of a Hospital Administration Medical Technical Specialist, remote site leaders ""plug into"" the single HICS system. Note: BCH's Waltham Inpatient is a position on the Inpatient Team and the other satellites are represented on the Outpatient Team. When necessary, BCH will activate HICS and open the Hospital Command Center. Based on the available information, the decision to initiate the response phase of emergency management is made by the Administrator on Duty (AOD). The AOD who activates HICS assumes the role of Incident Commander (IC). If the AOD is not on site, the Coordinator of Patient Placement (COPP) may be requested to fulfill a temporary Deputy IC role until the AOD arrives. Deputy IC responsibilities include providing situational awareness, updates, and other duties as assigned until the AOD arrives. The IC, based on specific circumstances of the event, will activate any and all appropriate Command and General Staff positions. An IC is always identified for every actual or potential event, and other portions of HICS may or may not be activated. All staff with the potential to fill a role on the HICS organization chart have been offered training on IS 100, 200, and 700 and a BCH custom HICS course. In this training, attendees are taught that they report solely to their immediate supervisor as outlined in the HICS structure (or ""unity of command""). If they are not serving in a HICS role, they continue to report to their regularly designated supervisor, manager or director. At the core of the BCH HICS structure is an organizational chart, which outlines the responder role reporting structure (or ""chain of command""). Each HICS position has a Job Action Sheet (JAS). The JAS serves as a checklist of duties to be accomplished in priority sequence. HICS is used in the management of every emergency event, regardless of size. Only positions that are necessary for the event are activated, and positions may be activated or deactivated at any time. Assignments to various roles may change over the course of the event. The AOD is initially notified of a potential event through the hospital paging system, e-mail, phone, and/or internal notification. Staff who may initiate the notification can include, but are not limited to: Emergency Department, Risk Management, Security, Engineering, Emergency Management, Infection Prevention & Control (IPC), Information Services Department (ISD), Clinical Education and Informatics (CEI), Ambulatory Clinics, and Satellite leadership. All staff are empowered to escalate concerns to the AOD directly, if necessary. On-duty staff members may be notified of a potential event via overhead page, digital group pagers (some of which ring to mobile phones), Connect Messenger, or e-mail ( see Communications Matrix ). A disaster hot-line number is also available for staff to call for additional information. Off-duty staff members who are needed for the emergency response may be notified via personal pager, telephone, cell phone, and/ or e-mail. Each BCH department is responsible for maintaining an emergency call list of their staff members. Off-site physicians are notified of a potential event via their Directors or Chiefs. Physicians' HICS positions will be filled as deemed necessary by the AOD using available staff. Upon notification of a HICS assignment, staff members will report to the Hospital Command Center (HCC) (or established conference call line) to receive their specific job assignments, relevant documentation, and disaster identification (if required). As appointments are made, some appointees will be required to make additional appointments in accordance with the HICS organization chart and distribute appropriate HICS materials. Each individual will fulfill the responsibilities as listed on his/her JAS. During the implementation of HICS, a record of position assignments and the person assuming the role is maintained in the HCC. HICS activations require that staff assuming a HICS role ""sign in"" at the HCC to help maintain staff accountability and clarity of assigned roles.

What is the smallest bone in the human body,"Mastocytosis is a rare disorder that results in too many mast cells that build up in the body. A mast cell is a type of white blood cell that is found in connective tissues throughout the body. Mast cells assist the immune system to function properly and normally help protect the body from diseases. Systemic mastocytosis is an excess of mast cells that build up in the skin, bone marrow, digestive tract and other body organs. When triggered, the mast cells release substances similar to an allergic reaction and sometimes trigger severe inflammation. Children with mastocytosis are at risk for mast cell degranulation in the perioperative setting. They are given pre-medications to help reduce the risk of mast cell degranulation and/or anaphylactic reactions. Medications are ordered in a power plan (e.g. corticosteroids, H1 and H2 antagonists and leukotriene receptor antagonists).","1.

When was the Renaissance,"At the bottom of the consent form document, the witness confirms that the information in the consent form and other written documents were accurately explained to and ostensibly understood by, the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, and that the informed consent was given voluntarily. A witness signature is required only in the following circumstances: 1. If the IRB approves the use of the short form method of consent. In this situation the witness signature only attests to the fact that the information was explained in the subject's native language and the subject/family had opportunities to ask questions 2. When the subject cannot read, and the consent document must be read to them. When communication impairments limit a subject's ability to unambiguously register consent. In such cases, it is important that there be an independent observer of the communication. 3. When given the nature of the research and the anticipated condition of a subject, the IRB is concerned that questions may arise as to whether consent/assent is being given knowingly and voluntarily.

OR ""A"" becomes an extension of the ICU (OR ""A"" room set up) 2. The ICU attending physician determines the time of cessation of mechanical ventilation and removes the endotracheal tube 3. Non-ME cases: Disconnect all IV lines and tubes ( please refer to Care after Death policy). Note: All ME cases require that all lines and tubes are left intact 4. Time of extubation is recorded by ICU staff and NEDS representative 5. NEDS coordinator monitors and record vital signs for up to 120 minutes 6. Death from cardiac and respiratory arrest may occur at any given time, following withdrawal of mechanical support 7. Procurement is cancelled if asystole does not occur within 120 minutes after life support is withdrawn 8. Asystole within 120 minutes is determined by: a. A-circulation confirmed by absence of palpable pulse b. Absence of heart sounds by auscultation c. A-circulation can also be confirmed by absence of pulsatility on arterial line waveform and/or absence of contraction and ejection of blood from heart on echocardiogram d. Loss of mechanical activity by the heart may occur prior to loss of electrical activity on an EKG tracing 9. After the asystole occurs in OR ""A"", the patient is promptly transferred to OR ""P"".

Debriefing is an essential mechanism to enhance interdisciplinary communication about a death and to reduce burnout in providers and rotating trainees. Without debriefing, many team members are left with the feeling that they are alone in their experience of a death. Even a 15 minute debrief can help and set the stage for further conversations and respectful communication between team members. When to debrief, or Why debrief immediately? Scheduling a debriefing for a later date so that everyone who was involved with a death can attend is a very challenging task and often fails to occur. Debriefing immediately does not rule out other debriefings being scheduled later. It can be scheduled before or after bringing child to the morgue but after parents have left the hospital. The neighboring RN or CRN can cover the bedside RN's other patients so that s/he may participate. Who should initiate/lead/attend the debrief? Anyone on the team can (and should) ask for the debrief to be arranged. Generally co-facilitated by fellow or attending and bedside RN, charge RN, or CRN but anyone on the team can lead a debrief (see directions above).

Label milk according to hospital policy – see Breastfeeding Family Education sheet: Instructions for Labeling and Storage of Breastmilk . Drying Tubing 1. Instruct parent to keep breast pump power on: ◦ Disconnect the collection system from the tubing at the breast shield connector and place the tubing over the top of the pump. ◦ Allow the pump to run to air for several minutes. This will eliminate any moisture or condensation that may have collected in the tubing. ◦ Open the top of the Symphony pump and remove the round caps and tubing. ◦ Inspect the tubing for visible soil – if it requires cleaning, wash in soapy water and rinse in cold water. Shake water out. ◦ Reconnect the tubing to the pump and allow pump to run for several minutes until tubing is dry. Note: Moisture is created by the movement of air through the tubing. Dry the tubing to prevent contamination of the tubing with mildew and to decrease the likelihood of contamination of milk. Cleaning 1. Instruct the parent to use disinfectant wipes to clean the outside of the breast pump and any surfaces involved in the process. 2. Take apart all pump kit pieces that touch the milk, including the small yellow valve and white membrane. 3. Place pump kit parts in a hospital wash basin for cleaning. 4. Rinse with cold water to remove milk residue. 5. Use clean hot water and dish soap to wash pump kit. ◦ Clean the hard-to-reach areas including the funnel piece, connector grooves, and small valve with white membrane. 6. Rinse all parts with warm water to remove soap. 7. Drain wash basin, and place pump parts in basin on dry paper towel. Cover with another dry paper towel. 8. Perform hand hygiene. Daily Breast Pump Equipment Sanitizing 1. Sanitize breast pump equipment once a day while in the hospital using Medela Quick Clean Micro-Steam Bags. ◦ At home, pump kits can also be sanitized in a dishwasher that has a special hot-water sanitizing cycle, or by boiling the pieces in a large pot for 15 minutes. 2. Write patient name on Micro-Steam bag in the space provided on the back. Note: Each bag can be used for 20 separate microwave sterilizing sessions – check off a box each time the bag is used. 3. Wash equipment as described above. 4. Place all of the pump parts except tubing into the bag. 5. Add 2 ounces (60mL) of water to the bag and close it securely. 6. Place the bag in the microwave and set the timer according to the instructions on the bag and the microwave in use (about 3 minutes for most hospital microwaves). 7. Instruct parent when the microwave stops to remove the bag using a paper towel because the bag contents are hot. Allow bag to cool before opening. Note: A pour spout will open on one side of the bag - be careful not to spill the hot water on your skin. Pour remaining water into the sink. 8.

When was the Battle of Hastings,"At the bottom of the consent form document, the witness confirms that the information in the consent form and other written documents were accurately explained to and ostensibly understood by, the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, and that the informed consent was given voluntarily. A witness signature is required only in the following circumstances: 1. If the IRB approves the use of the short form method of consent. In this situation the witness signature only attests to the fact that the information was explained in the subject's native language and the subject/family had opportunities to ask questions 2. When the subject cannot read, and the consent document must be read to them. When communication impairments limit a subject's ability to unambiguously register consent. In such cases, it is important that there be an independent observer of the communication. 3. When given the nature of the research and the anticipated condition of a subject, the IRB is concerned that questions may arise as to whether consent/assent is being given knowingly and voluntarily. In these situations, verification of the consent may help to protect subjects, who may be temporarily sick or too upset to provide meaningful consent/assent under the anticipated circumstances.","Document a room and/or person search only when there is reasonable basis that requires a detailed room search or patient search.

What is the chemical symbol for carbon,"1. All euthanasia of research animals performed at Boston Children's Hospital must conform with the following: a. The method must be consistent with the current AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia, unless scientifically or medically justified by the PI. b. The person performing euthanasia must be fully trained in the appropriate procedures, as it is essential that euthanasia be performed in a compassionate manner by personnel who are skilled in methods appropriate for the species. c. Death of the animal must be confirmed prior to removal from the room. d. Standard ARCH housing densities must be adhered to during transport and euthanasia procedures e. Combining rodents into a single cage (following standard housing densities) must minimize the potential for aggression. Male rodents from separate cages must not be placed into a single cage during transport or during euthanasia with inhaled agents. Similarly, a female (or females) must not be placed in a cage with multiple males, as this may result in the males fighting during transport or euthanasia procedures. f. Investigators must follow posted guidelines at euthanasia stations. 2. The selection of specific agents and methods for euthanasia will depend on the species involved and the objectives of the protocol. Generally, inhalant or non-inhalant chemical agents (e.g., barbiturates, non- explosive inhalant anesthetics, and CO2) are preferable to physical methods (e.g., cervical dislocation, decapitation). However, scientific consideration might preclude the use of certain agents for some protocols. For a description of acceptable methods of euthanasia by species, please refer to the Animal Research Investigator's Manual. The use of dry ice to generate CO2 is prohibited. The AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia specifically state that ""compressed carbon dioxide gas in cylinders is the only recommended source of carbon dioxide because the inflow to the chamber can be regulated precisely. Carbon dioxide generated by other methods such as from dry ice, fire extinguishers, or chemical means (e.g., antacids) is unacceptable. 3. The method(s) of euthanasia is reviewed and approved by the IACUC prior to initiation. If alternatives to accepted forms of euthanasia are to be used, criteria to determine appropriateness of methods include the ability to induce rapid loss of consciousness and death with no or only momentary pain, distress, or anxiety; reliability; non-reversibility; species and age limitations; and safety of and emotional effect on personnel. 4. If the research facility is evacuated as a result of an emergency, animals undergoing surgery may be euthanized by any AVMA-approved method appropriate for the species being used. 5. Death in mammals can be confirmed by listening for or palpating a heartbeat, monitoring for respirations for at least one minute (some animals develop apnea which can mimic cessation of breathing) or observing dilation of the pupils. Frequently, rodents urinate upon death as well. 6. For zebrafish, death is confirmed by the cessation of movement, both in terms of gross motor movement as well as the opercula","The Chemical Inventory Reconciliation is performed annually, on behalf of the organization, by the Environmental Health and Safety Department. Hazardous Materials storage locations captured within the CISPro electronic chemical inventory program are located within the Enders, Karp, CLS, Fegan, Farley, Hunnewell, Bader, Pavillion, Waltham, Lexington and Peabody locations. Hazardous materials are ordered throughout the year by various areas using a specific approval code within PeopleSoft. These orders are reviewed by the Environmental Health & Safety Department to assure users have the appropriate use and storage locations, waste disposal facilities, training, and other relevant chemical safety parameters before the material is ordered by the supply chain purchase agent. Approved materials are entered into the CISPro database to enable supply chain the ability to create location/bottle specific bar codes which instantaneously updates the chemical inventory upon arrival of the material. Employees are required to remove the CISPro bar codes from chemical containers and affix them to the posted disposal sheets within the laboratory. Environmental Health & Safety provides new disposal bar code sheets within the laboratory, scans discarded bar codes, and updates the system. When a new chemical is introduced or an old chemical is removed that will change the NFPA rating for the room, the Environmental Health and Safety Department adjusts the hazard ratings and updates the NFPA 704 Diamond sign. Completing a Manual Chemical Inventory The process noted below is to be performed by hazardous material users not currently captured within the CISPro inventory program. For example, laboratories moving in after the annual reconciliation, new offsite locations, previously existing spaces now requiring hazardous materials, etc How To Determine if a Chemical is Hazardous Hazard ratings can be found on the chemical label and may appear in numerical form as in the 704 Diamond, or in image form or text form. Information to Include on the Chemical Inventory The chemical inventory should be done in an Excel spreadsheet provided by the Environmental Health and Safety Department. The spreadsheet must include: • Principal Investigator (P.I.), laboratory representative and emergency contact names and off-hours phone number (i.e. home or cell phone number) • Location of where the chemical is kept (i.e. room number, bay number, or flammable cabinet) • Chemical name • CAS # (Chemical Abstract System number) • Physical state (solid or liquid) • New quantity • Brand (i.e. Aldrich, Sigma, VWR) • Any NFPA information if known from MSDSs For Principal Investigators that have more than one laboratory location, a spreadsheet needs to be submitted for each laboratory location, for proper room hazard designation. Example Spreadsheet Set-up: Chemicals have a way of turning up in the least likely locations and therefore, to perform an accurate and complete inventory of the lab, all cabinets, shelves, corners and cubbies must be checked! Take this opportunity to discard any old, out of date or no longer used chemicals. Label these chemicals with a Hazardous Waste label, place them in the Satellite Accumulation Areas and submit a Hazardous Waste Pick-up Request Form . Note: If you discover a chemical that does not look as it should or a container that does not appear to be intact, DO NOT MOVE THE CHEMICAL. Call ext 5-3499; briefly describe the situation, and ask to have the Safety-on-Call person paged. Submitting the Chemical Inventory Spreadsheet Forward the completed Chemical Inventory spreadsheet as an email attachment to the Environmental Health and Safety Department. What will the Chemical Inventories be used for? Environmental Health and Safety will use these inventories to identify the hazard level of each laboratory in the Enders Facility and will update the 704 Diamond sign located on every entrance door to a lab. Copies of the completed inventories will be placed with security for easy access in an emergency. Additionally, any ""4"" ratings will be highlighted for quick reference in an emergency situation. There may be some instances where the label does not identify the contents as hazardous. In this case, refer to the Material Safety Data Sheet for the specific chemical information.

This includes drugs used for non-survival procedures. In certain cases, the IACUC may approve the use of non-pharmaceutical- grade compounds, if scientifically justified by the investigator. Justification must include a discussion of: • Why a pharmaceutical-grade compound cannot be used (e.g., non-availability of a veterinary or human pharmaceutical-grade product; pharmaceutical grade agents are not the correct concentration and/or formulation). Cost savings alone is not an acceptable justification. • Investigators may also provide a reference to support that no adverse events are expected based on the non-pharmaceutical grade nature of the agent. For all non-pharmaceutical grade agents, investigators must ensure that pH, purity, stability, and sterility concerns are addressed.",0,0,0,0,0
Who wrote The Canterbury Tales,"1. When research meets the definition of research involving a human being as an experimental subject, and consent is to be obtained from the experimental subject's legal representative, the research must intend to benefit the individual subject. a. The determination that research is intended to be beneficial to the individual experimental subject must be made by an IRB.","1. Discuss with the team the plan for confirming acirculation (pulselessness). If the patient does not have an arterial line and one is not going to be placed or the current a line reading is questionable, confirm that an echocardiography attending and echo machine will be present in the OR. 2. Heparin (300 u/kg) will be administered to the patient when he/she becomes hypotensive (MAP<50 mmHg for patients over 10 years old, MAP<40 mmHg for patients 1-10 years old, MAP<30 for patients less than 1 year old). 3. If time permits, one ICU nurse should go down to OR ""A"" and check that it's set up as expected (suction, second bed if the family wants, rocking chairs, tissues, music, sheets covering equipment to make it look less OR-like, bed near plug or with extension cord). 4. An OR nurse meets the family on the unit and accompanies the patient, family and team to the OR. 5. Prior to transfer to the OR, huddle with the care team and NEOB to discuss: ◦ Roles, specifically: i. Who will give medications, including heparin, how, and dose ii. Who will talk with the family in the OR to describe the OR layout and personnel and remind them of the order of events while the team is getting the patient set up in the room. iii. Who will accompany the family when they leave the room and who will update the family after the donation; where will the family be located. ◦ Which clock will be used, insure synchronization 6. The patient remains in the care of the ICU team until the patient is transferred to the second OR for organ donation and then again after donation if family wishes to see the child after organ recovery is completed. 7. Only the ICU attending or fellow can declare acirculation (pulselessness). The same attending/fellow accompanies the patient into the second OR (B) to confirm that there is no spontaneous return of pulses (auto-resuscitation) during the 5 minutes following acirculation. They will continue to use the transport monitor during the transfer to the second OR (B).",A specialized protocol application has been developed for secondary use of human biological specimen/data review.
