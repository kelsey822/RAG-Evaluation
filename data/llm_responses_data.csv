What are the potential risks associated with holding enteral feeds around packed RBC transfusions for very low birth weight infants,"The potential risks associated with holding enteral feeds around packed RBC transfusions for very low birth weight infants are not yet fully understood, and the available evidence is conflicting. Some studies suggest that holding enteral feeds during transfusions may increase the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a serious inflammatory condition of the intestine that affects up to 10% of very low birth weight infants. This condition is sometimes referred to as transfusion-associated NEC (TANEC) or transfusion associated gut injury (TRAGI) when it occurs within 48 hours of an RBC transfusion.TANEC is estimated to account for 20-35% of NEC episodes and is associated with increased need for surgical intervention, longer hospitalization, and higher mortality compared to infants with NEC unrelated to RBC transfusion. Several mechanisms for TANEC have been proposed, including severe anemia leading to impaired blood flow to the gut, exposure to immunological mediators in transfused blood that trigger an immune reaction, and ischemia/reperfusion injury associated with RBC transfusion.However, it's important to note that stopping enteral feedings is not without risk. Prolonging time to reach full milk feeds is associated with infection and can also be associated with an increased risk of NEC. Until further evidence is available, it is reasonable to implement enteral feeding guidelines similar to those under investigation in the WHEAT trial, which randomizes infants to continue enteral feeds during transfusion or hold enteral feeds 4 hours before, during, and 4 hours after transfusion.In practice, many NICUs have adopted the practice of holding enteral feeds peri-transfusion in hopes of minimizing any potential risk of developing TANEC. But the wide variation in the currently available evidence and available feeding protocols makes it difficult to determine the best feeding practices around and during RBC transfusions.",1,1,0,0,

What is the protocol for administering radiation to female patients age 12 and over,"The protocol for administering radiation to female patients aged 12 and over involves several steps to ensure the safety of the patient, particularly in relation to the potential for pregnancy.Firstly, the radiologic technologist will verify the patient's identity and ensure the order for the procedure matches the patient's expectations. They will also determine the menstrual status of all female patients over the age of 11, taking into account the social, emotional, and cultural implications of such an inquiry.If the patient could potentially be pregnant, the technologist will inquire about this. If the potential for pregnancy cannot be reasonably excluded, a pregnancy test should be considered. If a patient is pregnant, the physician will be consulted to determine the necessity of the examination. The patient may only be radiographed in a life-threatening situation or after an explanation of the risks and benefits and signing consent to the examination.For radiologic procedures that could potentially be harmful to a fetus, such as interventional fluoroscopic procedures of the abdomen or pelvis, diagnostic angiography of the abdomen or pelvis, diagnostic CT examinations that include the abdomen or pelvis, and treatment with 131-I-radioiodine for thyroid cancer, a pregnancy test will be performed.For certain procedures where the dose to the fetus is estimated to be less than 20 mGy (2 rad), verification of pregnancy status by clinical history may be sufficient. These include examinations like Murphy Hip CT, non-contrast CT urogram, PET/CT or SPECT/CT exams that do not include diagnostic CT imaging of the abdomen or pelvis, and many X-ray-based examinations.Lastly, if the patient is receiving moderate or deep sedation, an HCG test will be performed.

What are the potential causes of a heart murmur in infants and children and why is it important to differentiate between a benign murmur and a murmur indicating heart disease,"A heart murmur in infants and children is a sound of turbulent blood flow, which can be caused by a valve defect or other anatomic variant. While heart murmurs are common and often benign, they can sometimes indicate heart disease. To differentiate between a benign murmur and one indicating heart disease, it's important to consider other symptoms.Potential causes of a heart murmur that may indicate heart disease include stenotic valvular lesions (like aortic stenosis or pulmonary stenosis), which are audible immediately after birth and persist with a harsh quality, and left-to-right shunt lesions (like a large ventricular septal defect, atrioventricular canal, or patent ductus arteriosus), which occur later (days to weeks of age) as pulmonary vascular resistance decreases, and have a blowing quality that is usually systolic but may be continuous.Cyanosis (with or without congestive heart failure), shock (with or without congestive heart failure), cardiac rhythm disturbances, and failed congenital heart disease screen can also suggest heart disease. It's crucial to differentiate between a benign murmur and a murmur indicating heart disease because the latter may require further evaluation and treatment by a cardiologist to prevent serious complications.",0,0,1,0,

An alternative method, transcutaneous CO2 (PTCCO2), may be used for trending if a correlation with arterial CO2 (PaCO2) has been established. Additionally, monitoring CO2 production (V̇CO2) can help assess the patient's response to bronchodilator therapy, metabolic demand, and titration of ventilator settings. It may also provide information about changes in pulmonary blood flow when adjusting medical gas therapy, such as inhaled nitric oxide.",1,0,0,0,
How are Adverse Drug Events ADEs categorized and what are the two main categories for ADEs,"Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) are categorized based on the severity of their impact on the patient's health. The main categories for ADEs are:1. Preventable Medication Events (Medication Errors): These are adverse events that could have been avoided with appropriate care. They include errors in medication prescription, dispensation, administration, or monitoring.2. Non-preventable Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs): These are unintended, noxious responses to a drug that occur at doses used for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or treatment of disease, or for the modification of physiological function. These reactions are not preventable as they are often unpredictable and can occur even when the medication is used correctly.The severity of ADEs can range from minor transient changes in condition that require no intervention (Level 1), to major changes that are life-threatening if not treated (Level 4), and even death (Level 5). The specific level is determined by the extent of harm caused to the patient and the degree of intervention required.",1,0,0,0,
Why is there uncertainty regarding the causal association between red blood cell transfusions and NEC in neonates,"The uncertainty regarding the causal association between red blood cell (RBC) transfusions and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in neonates arises from conflicting results in multiple meta-analyses and studies over the years. Some research suggests that both the severity of anemia and the RBC transfusion together may increase the risk of TANEC (Transfusion-Associated NEC). However, other studies have not found a clear association.Until further evidence is available, some Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) have adopted the practice of withholding feeds during RBC transfusions to potentially minimize the risk of developing TANEC. This approach is considered reasonable, especially for neonates at higher risk of NEC. However, it's important to note that stopping enteral feedings is not without risk, as it can prolong the time to reach full milk feeds, which is associated with an increased risk of infection and NEC.The WHEAT trial, which is investigating the association between feeding during RBC transfusion and the risk of developing TANEC, may provide further information to guide feeding practices during RBC transfusions. Until then, the wide variation in the currently available evidence makes it difficult to determine the best feeding practices around and during RBC transfusions.",1,0,0,0,

According to the guidelines for the prevention of intravascular catheterrelated infections what are some strategies to prevent central LineAssociated bloodstream infections in acute care hospitals,"Based on the provided sources, here are some strategies to prevent Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections (CLABSI) in acute care hospitals:1. Hand Hygiene: Ensure that healthcare personnel perform hand hygiene before and after touching the catheter or the catheter site.2. Maximal Barrier Precautions: Use maximal barrier precautions during the insertion of central venous catheters (CVCs). This includes the use of a cap, mask, sterile gown, sterile gloves, and a sterile full-body drape.3. Skin Antisepsis: Use chlorhexidine with alcohol for skin antisepsis before CVC insertion and during dressing changes.4. Optimal Catheter Site Selection: The subclavian vein is the preferred site for CVC insertion due to a lower risk of infection compared to the femoral or jugular veins.5. Daily Assessment: Regularly assess the need for the central line and remove it as soon as it is no longer necessary.6. Dressing and Securement: Use a sterile gauze or sterile, transparent, semipermeable dressing to cover the catheter site. Change the dressing if it becomes damp, loosened, or soiled.7. Chlorhexidine-Impregnated Dressings: Consider using chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings for CVCs, as they have been shown to reduce the risk of CLABSI.8. Education and Training: Ensure that healthcare personnel are adequately trained and educated about the correct procedures for CVC insertion, maintenance, and removal.These strategies are based on the guidelines for the prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections and the 2014 update on strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute care hospitals.",0,0,1,0,

What are the indications for performing synchronized cardioversion and defibrillation in a clinical setting,"Synchronized cardioversion and defibrillation are performed in clinical settings for patients with cardiac rhythm disturbances and unstable hemodynamics. The procedure is indicated when the patient's condition is assessed, and it's confirmed that they have an abnormal heart rhythm.Synchronized cardioversion is typically used for conditions like atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation. It involves delivering a timed, electrical shock during the down slope of the R wave or with the S wave.Defibrillation, on the other hand, is used when the patient is pulseless or in cases of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. It involves delivering an unsynchronized electrical shock to restore normal heart rhythm.Before performing either procedure, it's important to assess the patient's ABCs (Airway, Breathing, and Circulation), initiate oxygen therapy, and obtain vascular access. Sedation may be considered for responsive patients. After the procedure, the patient's cardiac rhythm should be reassessed.The energy levels for cardioversion and defibrillation are guided by the American Heart Association Pediatric Advanced Life Support guidelines, starting from 0.5 - 1 J/kg for cardioversion and 2 J/kg for defibrillation, and increasing if the initial attempts are unsuccessful.During the procedure, patient and team member safety should be maintained, and the appropriate-sized paddles/pads should be used with conductive gel or pre-gelled defibrillation pads. It's also important to document a recording of the ECG before and after each event.In cases of Automatic Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (AICD) malfunction, defibrillation or cardioversion may be performed if indicated, avoiding placing the defibrillator paddles/pads over the AICD device. If the AICD is delivering shocks that are not indicated, a magnet may be placed over the device to disable it, but only with authorization from the Medical Control Physician.",1,0,0,0,

How can the information in the document Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ERASpdf be utilized to improve patient care in the hospital,"The document ""Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)"" provides a framework for improving patient care in the hospital by implementing patient-centered, evidence-based, multidisciplinary team developed pathways. These pathways are designed to reduce the patient's surgical stress response, optimize their physiologic function, and facilitate recovery. They form an integrated continuum of care as the patient moves from home through the pre-hospital, preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases of surgery and back home again.To utilize this information, hospitals can develop service-specific ERAS protocols for various surgical procedures such as abdominal surgery, orthognathic procedures, and cardiac surgery, among others. These protocols should be noted on the OR booking sheet and communicated to all relevant staff.During care coordination, nursing staff should note ""ERAS"" in the special needs, anesthesia pre-op discussion, and nursing communication sections of the Pre-Anesthesia Evaluation Form (PAEF). A copy of the appropriate service-specific ERAS protocol should be printed and placed in the patient's paper chart for review at the pre-op visit.During the pre-op visit or phone call, the nursing staff should review the pre-op portion of the ERAS protocol with the patient and refer the family to the surgeon and/or anesthesiologist for additional questions related to ERAS.In addition, hospitals can participate in data collection related to ERAS, such as patient and family satisfaction via Press Ganey, National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators (NDNQI), and Quality Assurance Process Improvement (QAPI) strategies.

According to the PHS Policy what is the focus of the policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals,"The PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals focuses on ensuring the humane treatment of all vertebrate species used in research. A major aspect of this policy is minimizing pain and distress for these animals whenever possible. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) plays a key role in implementing this policy.The policy requires that all procedures with the potential to cause pain or distress must be justified and alternatives that could reduce pain or distress must be explored. If a procedure is expected to cause more than momentary pain or distress, the investigator must provide information on what steps will be taken to alleviate this, such as the use of analgesics.The policy also emphasizes the importance of recognizing signs of pain and distress in animals, and provides guidelines for this. It requires that all possible measures must be taken to minimize animal discomfort and distress.In cases where pain and distress cannot be relieved due to the nature of the experiment, the policy requires that explicit parameters be established to determine when an animal should be euthanized to prevent extreme or unnecessary suffering.The policy further requires that all personnel involved in animal care and use are appropriately qualified and trained to perform their duties, including the humane care and use of animals. This includes providing adequate training in the humane methods of animal maintenance and experimentation, the use of anesthetics, analgesics, and tranquilizers, and the reporting of deficiencies in animal care and treatment.In summary, the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals is designed to ensure that all vertebrate animals used in research are treated humanely, with a focus on minimizing pain and distress. It requires justification for any procedures that may cause pain or distress, the use of appropriate measures to alleviate pain and distress, and the establishment of parameters for euthanasia in cases where pain and distress cannot be relieved.

If the prescription is for a limited distribution drug that the pharmacy does not have access to, the patient is notified and the prescription is transferred to a pharmacy that can fill it (source 2 and source 3).The pharmacy also assists with the prior authorization process. A clinic-specific pharmacy liaison performs a benefits investigation to determine the patient’s prescription insurance and contacts the insurer to determine if a prior authorization is required. If it is, the liaison works with the prescriber and insurer to complete and submit the request form, and monitors its status (source 2).In terms of financial assistance, the liaison attempts to obtain financial aid through manufacturer programs, non-profit foundations, and government-sponsored programs if the patient's out-of-pocket cost is greater than five dollars. The liaison also works directly with the patient to obtain necessary financial information or signatures, and with the pharmacy to ensure the aid is applied to the patient's copay (source 2).The pharmacy has specific guidelines for accepting a patient, including living in the defined service area and having the ability to pay for services. All services are provided utilizing acceptable professional procedures and performed by appropriately trained personnel (source 3).The pharmacy also provides post-enrollment patient information, including details about patient access to pharmacy information and support services, patient financial responsibilities, and how to contact patient support services and obtain prescription order status (source 4).In summary, the specialty pharmacy at Boston Children's Hospital ensures patient access to services through careful prescription review, assistance with prior authorization and financial aid, clear communication about patient responsibilities, and provision of ongoing support and information.",1,0,0,0,"1,2,3"

What factors does the Department of Children and Families DCF consider when making a determination about providing psychiatric treatment or administering Psychotropic medications to a child under their care and protection,"The Department of Children and Families (DCF) considers several factors when deciding about providing psychiatric treatment or administering psychotropic medications to a child under their care and protection.Firstly, DCF distinguishes between routine and extraordinary care. Psychiatric treatment or psychotropic medications are typically considered extraordinary care due to their complexity, potential side effects, and intrusiveness.In such cases, DCF must provide informed consent for all medications, except for the use of anti-psychotic medication. For anti-psychotic medications, DCF needs to seek prior judicial approval.The decision-making process takes into account the clarity of the medical opinion on the need for the proposed care, the extent of conflicting interests between the decision-makers and what is in the best interests of the child, and the extent of prior judicial involvement in healthcare decision-making on behalf of the child.If the child is in DCF custody because of a voluntary placement, including a Child Requiring Assistance (CRA) application, the consent decision remains with the parents.In an emergency situation, where failure to medicate will result in a substantial likelihood of physical harm to the child or others, medication can be provided without prior consent. However, the facts supporting the psychiatrist's judgment that an emergency exists should be documented in the patient's medical record.These guidelines ensure that the best interests of the child are prioritized while making decisions about psychiatric treatment and the administration of psychotropic medications.",1,0,0,0,

Under what circumstances should CPAP therapy be initiated during a diagnostic study for a splitnight study,"CPAP therapy during a diagnostic study for a split-night study should be initiated under the following circumstances:1. A minimum of 2 hours of diagnostic PSG (Polysomnography) has been conducted with an AHI (Apnea-Hypopnea Index) of at least 30.2. An AHI greater than 20 with documented symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired cognition, mood disorders, insomnia, documented hypertension, ischemic heart disease, or history of stroke.3. Split night may be considered at an AHI of 15-40 based on clinical judgment.4. CPAP could be initiated during the diagnostic PSG by the technician as an emergency measure when multiple apneas leading to severe oxygen desaturation (below 70%) and/or prolonged apneas (more than 60 seconds) are observed.5. There must be at least 3 hours remaining study time for the CPAP titration.The CPAP pressure should be started at 5cw and titrated upward by 1cw to eliminate obstruction. Pressure should be increased slowly with a minimum of 5 minutes between 1cw increases. The optimal titration is where all obstructive events and snoring are resolved. Acceptable titration is where the obstructive RDI is < 5/hour.If a mask leak occurs, the tech should first fix the leakage before raising the pressure. Once the mask leak has been fixed, decrease the pressure to the last setting where mouth breathing and/or mask leakage was not present, and then re-titrate as indicated.If the patient takes a break from wearing the mask, do not decrease the CPAP pressure on attempted return to sleep unless the patient remains awake for 15 minutes or the patient specifically requests that the pressure be lowered.The use of bi-level positive airway pressure may be indicated if the patient is unable to tolerate CPAP secondary to persistent mouth breathing despite use of a full-face mask/chin strap, inability to exhale against higher expiratory pressures, or frequent central apneas.",1,0,0,0,
What are the recommended sizes for postpyloric feeding tubes and when should a 10 Fr 43 in feeding tube be considered,"The recommended sizes for postpyloric feeding tubes vary based on the patient's weight. For patients weighing 5 kg or less, a 6 Fr 22 in non-weighted feeding tube with a stylet is recommended. For patients weighing more than 5 kg, an 8 Fr 36-43 in non-weighted feeding tube with a stylet is suggested. A 10 Fr 43 in feeding tube can be considered for patients who are older than 12 years of age. The appropriate size of the nasal tube retaining system should be determined based on the feeding tube size. For instance, the Pediatric Pro Range™ comes in two sizes, 5F-6F and 8F-10F, to accommodate nasal tubes of the same size. It's also important to note that post-pyloric feedings are typically given continuously over a majority of the hours per day. If a patient is discharged with a post-pyloric tube, it's usually because they have improved with inpatient post-pyloric feedings or they continue to have severe illness that prompted the original placement of the post-pyloric tube. However, replacement of dislodged post-pyloric tubes typically does not occur at home or in most local Emergency Departments.

What are the potential risks associated with transfusing red blood cells with high potassium levels and how can these risks be minimized,"The potential risk associated with transfusing red blood cells with high potassium levels is an increase in the patient's circulating potassium level, which can lead to cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias and cardiovascular collapse.To minimize these risks, the following steps can be taken:1. Process the packed red blood cells in a cell saver before administration to help reduce the potassium level.2. Use conventional or zero balance ultrafiltration to control the circulating potassium level. This process removes plasma water, potassium, and other electrolytes. Normal saline should be added to reduce the amount of circulating potassium and replace needed volume.3. Monitor the serum potassium level frequently, especially during the administration of cardioplegia.4. Communicate with the anesthesiologist to determine if diuretics should be administered to help increase potassium excretion.5. Glucose and insulin may be administered under the direction of the attending anesthesiologist, as this regimen can help lower potassium levels.

How does Boston Childrens Hospital encourage the identification and reporting of adverse events by its staff,"Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) encourages the identification and reporting of adverse events by its staff through several policies and procedures. The hospital has a commitment to fostering a culture of safety and transparency, and has established policies for the internal reporting, classification, response, and disclosure of events, including adverse events and adverse drug events.Staff are encouraged to report any occurrence of an adverse event, near miss, or situation that places a patient at increased risk of harm, or any unplanned significant change in medical or surgical management not related to the patient’s underlying condition. This can be done through the hospital’s internal web-based Safety Event Report System (SERS) within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. Any hospital employee, volunteer, Medical Staff member, or House Staff member may report an adverse event. If staff are uncertain whether an event is a reportable adverse event, they are advised to err on the side of reporting.The hospital also has educational processes in place to encourage the identification and expected reporting of such events by any member of the hospital's staff. The responsibility for investigating and responding to events resides with the Program for Pharmacy Safety and Quality (PPSQ), but may be delegated to the individual or department reporting the event for events of lower severity and that are not externally reportable.In addition, adverse drug events (ADEs) are presented and summarized monthly to the Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T) Committee for review and recommendations for action if needed. The Pharmacy Director of Safety and Quality and the Specialty Pharmacy Manager will meet quarterly to discuss any ADEs during the quarter or the discussion will take place during quarterly Quality Management Committee (QMC) meetings. A detailed analysis will be compiled which may include a plan of correction and a process for quality improvement.Overall, BCH has a robust system in place to encourage the identification and reporting of adverse events by its staff, with a focus on transparency, education, and continuous improvement.",1,0,0,0,
How does the hospital handle patient safety events and complaints and what reporting systems are in place for these incidents,"The hospital, Boston Children's Hospital (BCH), has established processes for handling patient safety events, accidents, and near miss events. These processes are in place for patients, employees, visitors, and others at the hospital. There are three primary systems for reporting such events:1. Safety Event Reporting System (SERS): This system allows for direct, standardized entry of data in a structured format. It ensures efficient communication of events to clinical leaders and the Program for Patient Safety and Quality (PPSQ). It also allows for rapid identification of events requiring additional follow-up and/or analysis, and efficient production of standardized and customized reports for departments and the hospital.2. Employee Accident Report (EAR): This process provides the framework for investigating actual or potential work-related injuries. The completion of the Employee Accident Report provides the documentation from which the BCH Occupational Health Services Department develops a ""First Report of Injury"" form required by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The nature, type, and extent of injuries/illnesses are tracked to identify trends that may trigger further investigation.3. Security Incident Report: This report provides for the monitoring of all security-related incidents involving patients, employees, visitors, and other people at the hospital grounds or facilities. The reports are recorded by the Security Department, summarized by number and type of incident, and reported to the Safety Committee quarterly.In addition to these, BCH is transitioning to an electronic injury reporting system, called the Employee Safety Event Reporting System (E-SERS). The same employee safety reporting process will be followed, but will be reported on a computer instead of on paper.BCH also works with contracted Patient Safety Organizations (PSOs) to improve patient safety and quality through review and analysis of patient safety events. They report defined events through one or more PSOs and share lessons learned to prevent future patient harm.Furthermore, BCH has a policy for internal reporting, classification, response, external reporting, and disclosure of events. The hospital has educational processes in place that encourage the identification and expected reporting of such events by any member of the hospital's staff.When a serious adverse event occurs, BCH uses a process called Root Cause Analysis (RCA) convening. This is a systematic review of events to ensure all causal factors are identified and a root cause is determined. Corrective actions that address the root cause are then developed to prevent similar events in the future.",1,0,0,0,
What are some examples of patient conditions that would necessitate the use of a postpyloric feeding tube according to the hospital policy,"Based on the sources provided, some examples of patient conditions that may necessitate the use of a postpyloric feeding tube according to hospital policy include:1.

What are the considerations for documenting adequate sleep before conducting the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test MWT,"Before conducting the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT), several considerations need to be taken into account for documenting adequate sleep:1. The patient and clinician should define goals for adequate sleep in terms of timing and duration.2. Adequate sleep should be documented through a sleep diary, and if possible, actigraphy for two weeks prior to the test.3. The MWT should be conducted when the patient is clinically stable, and any known sleep disorders are well-managed and effectively treated.4. For patients with sleep-disordered breathing, the effectiveness of therapy should be ensured before testing. If the effectiveness is suboptimal, the clinician should decide if the anticipated impact on the test results warrants rescheduling.5. The clinician should develop a plan for the use of prescription medications, over-the-counter agents, herbal remedies, and other substances. If the patient is chronically taking medications with alerting or sedating properties, they should be continued at a stable dose. Changes in medications should be avoided for two weeks before testing.6. The patient's use of tobacco, caffeine, and medications before and during the MWT should be determined by the sleep clinician. The patient should abstain from alcohol, marijuana, and other sedating substances on the day of the test. Drug screening may be necessary to ensure that sleepiness or wakefulness during the MWT is not influenced by substances other than medically prescribed drugs.7. Relevant clinical data such as preceding sleep schedules, PAP adherence, or other therapies should be available to the interpreting clinician. The MWT should be performed after the patient's major sleep period.",1,0,0,0,

In the context of allogeneic recipients what are the specific requirements for Human Leukocyte Antigen HLA typings as outlined in the hospital policy,"Allogeneic recipients require a minimum of two Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) typings, according to the hospital policy. One of these typings must be high resolution and completed by the American Red Cross (ARC), while the other must be from a buccal swab at ARC. Confirmatory typing can be low resolution if high resolution typing is already reported from ARC. The final patient and donor HLA report must be reviewed and signed by the patient's intake attending or program director prior to the patient being admitted to the SCT service for the start of conditioning. If a patient is receiving more than one allogeneic stem cell transplant, they do not require repeat HLA typing unless the criteria mentioned above have not been met or improved resolution typing is available. The final HLA report must be signed by the patient's intake attending or program director prior to the start of conditioning.Additionally, all allogeneic recipients of an HLA mismatched donor at A, B, C, DRB1, DQB, or DPB1 require an HLA antibody screen. For cryopreserved donor infusions, this screen must be within 30 days of starting donor mobilization or donor harvest when using a non-mobilized donor. For fresh donor infusions, the screen must be within 30 days of patient start of conditioning and within 30 days of infusion. If conditioning is not started within 30 days of patient HLA antibody screen, this study must be repeated, unless a planned deviation is approved by the Medical Director of Quality.All allogeneic recipients also require two independent samples resulted for ABO typing and red cell antibody screening. One ABO typing and red cell antibody screen must be within 7 days of transplant or on admission to SCT service to start conditioning. If cell infusion or conditioning is not started within 7 days of ABO typing and red cell antibody screen, this study must be repeated, unless a planned deviation is approved by the Medical Director of Quality.Infectious Disease Markers (IDMs) and pre-SCT labs must be collected and reviewed by intake attending to ensure results are within 30 days of start of conditioning. Abnormal lab findings are noted and acted upon, if necessary. For patients receiving subsequent stem cell infusions during the same SCT encounter with conditioning, IDMs and pre-SCT labs must be collected and reviewed by intake attending to ensure results are within 30 days of start of conditioning. If conditioning is not started within 30 days of IDMs, these studies must be repeated, unless a planned deviation is approved by the Medical Director of Quality. For patients receiving allogeneic stem cell infusions without conditioning, IDMs should be collected and reviewed by intake attending within 30 days of product infusion.All pre-SCT tests of organ function must be completed and reviewed by intake attending. Mandatory pre-SCT evaluations include an echocardiogram, pulmonary function test (for patients >5 years of age), dental evaluation, ophthalmologic evaluation, serum creatinine, GFR or 24-hour creatinine clearance, liver function tests, audiology evaluation, and restaging studies including bone marrow biopsy, Lumbar Puncture (LP), and imaging of involved sites of disease in all patients with hematologic malignancies if applicable. For patients with a diagnosis of MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome) and no known CNS involvement, CSF exam (LP) pre-SCT is optional and at intake attending discretion.Additional pre-evaluations to be considered by the intake attending include a pelvic ultrasound if female > 10 years old and no history of menstruation, menstrual prophylaxis in females > 12 years old, G6PD testing completed prior to start of conditioning, and pregnancy testing per Pregnancy Testing of Post-Menarcheal Female Patients. Patients must have or be planned for adequate venous access. For previously collected products, physicians must receive notification that the product arrived intact at the cell processing facility prior to the start of patient conditioning. For any product not being collected in advance of the start of patient conditioning, confirmation of final donor clearance must be obtained prior to the start of patients conditioning. A therapeutic profile must be completed and signed by the intake attending, and if the patient is >125% of IBW, a decision to use adjusted body weight must be noted in the therapeutic profile. The intake attending must also complete an Individualized Treatment Plan (ITP), if applicable, which must be signed by two attending physicians including the program Medical Director of Quality or designee and be scanned into the electronic medical record.",1,0,0,0,

What is the recommended technique for circuit priming preparation,"The recommended technique for circuit priming preparation involves several steps. Firstly, it's important to maintain a sterile technique throughout the procedure to minimize the risk of introducing pathogens into the circuit.The priming procedure is typically performed by a specialized professional, such as an ECMO Specialist or a licensed cardiovascular perfusionist. The process may vary slightly depending on the specific professional or the patient's weight. For instance, a blood primed circuit is used for patients weighing less than 15kg.The priming procedure generally involves inspecting the dialyzer for cracks and sterility, placing it vertically into the dialyzer holder, preparing the arterial and venous blood sets, and threading the blood pump in the blood pump segment.The arterial line is then connected to the arterial blood port at the top of the dialyzer, and the venous line to the venous blood port at the base. The dialyzer is rotated so that the arterial blood port is at the base, facilitating air removal.A standard priming solution, such as 1 liter of normal saline, is used to prime the circuit. The solution is infused into the circuit until it's free of air bubbles, which can be facilitated by intermittently clamping and releasing the arterial line just before the arterial blood port of the dialyzer.After at least 1 liter of the priming solution has been infused, the primed circuit is recirculated by joining the patient ends of the arterial and venous lines and adjusting the blood pump speed.Finally, after the machine has passed all pretreatment alarm testing, and conductivity and pH have been tested, the connectors are attached to the dialyzer, ensuring the venous line is engaged in the air detector sensor.",1,0,0,0,

Go to the hospital's main protocol page.2. Click on the ""Review Status"" tab.3. Scroll down to the ""CHB Staff"" section. The Principal Investigator (PI) is always an authorized prescriber. If an individual is listed under ""CHB Staff"" and has prescribing rights at the hospital, they are considered an authorized prescriber.4. For interventional trials, the protocol must be submitted to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and fully approved. Approved protocols are listed in CHeRP.5. Depending on the study design, authorized prescribers participating in trials conducted in an approved location may be listed in the protocol in two ways:   a. By individual name as a specific authorized prescriber within the protocol itself and in CHeRP.   b. By group within the protocol itself (e.g., “all licensed clinicians authorized to prescribe medications within the ED”).6. The PI is responsible for adding the names of the authorized prescribers to CHeRP and ensuring that they have completed the necessary protocol training.7. If the Investigational Product (IP) involved is managed by the pharmacy or Investigational Drug Service, the pharmacist must confirm that the prescriber has been authorized to prescribe the IP and that informed consent has been obtained prior to dispensing per the protocol.",1,0,0,0,
According to the hospital policies what are the recommended strategies for preventing central Lineu2013Associated bloodstream infections in acute care hospitals as of 2014,"According to the hospital policies based on the 2014 update of the ""Strategies to Prevent Central Line–Associated Bloodstream Infections in Acute Care Hospitals"" published in Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology, the following strategies are recommended to prevent Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections (CLABSI):1. Hand hygiene: Perform hand hygiene before and after touching the catheter or the catheter site.2. Maximal barrier precautions: Use maximal barrier precautions during the insertion of central venous catheters (CVCs) to minimize the introduction of microorganisms.3. Chlorhexidine skin antisepsis: Use chlorhexidine with alcohol for skin antisepsis during CVC insertion and during dressing changes.4. Optimal catheter site selection: Choose an appropriate catheter site based on the patient's clinical condition and the type of catheter to be inserted.5. Daily assessment of line necessity: Evaluate the need for the central line daily and remove it promptly when it is no longer required.6. Proper catheter securement and dressing: Use a sterile dressing to cover the insertion site, and secure the catheter to prevent dislodgement and minimize catheter movement.7. Education and training: Provide education and training to healthcare personnel involved in the insertion and maintenance of CVCs on the proper techniques and procedures to minimize the risk of infection.8. Monitoring and feedback: Implement a surveillance system to monitor CLABSI rates, and provide feedback to healthcare personnel to encourage adherence to the recommended strategies.9. Antimicrobial/antiseptic impregnated catheters: Consider using antimicrobial or antiseptic impregnated catheters in patients at high risk for CLABSI.10. Chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings: Use chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings to cover the insertion site in patients with high risk for CLABSI.These recommendations are based on a comprehensive review of the available evidence and expert consensus. Adherence to these strategies can significantly reduce the risk of CLABSI in acute care hospitals.",1,0,0,0,
What is the meaning of PPE when it comes to sterile compounding,"PPE in the context of sterile compounding refers to Personal Protective Equipment that is used to maintain a sterile environment and protect the individual from exposure to hazardous materials. This includes items such as gloves, gowns, and masks. For sterile compounding, outer sterile gloves must be ASTM 6978-rated and changed every 30 minutes or when contaminated. Gowns must be changed every 3 hours or less, or if contaminated. It's important to note that when compounding sterile preparations of hazardous products, a Closed System Transfer Device (CSTD) must be used to maintain a negative pressure within the vial and minimize exposure to the hazardous material. The use of PPE is crucial in maintaining a sterile environment and protecting the individual during sterile compounding processes.",1,0,0,0,
What special considerations should be taken for trach and trachventdependent patients perioperatively,"Special considerations for trach and trach/vent-dependent patients perioperatively include:1. Care Coordination: Document trach details (type, size, cuff), suction (frequency, catheter size), vent (type, settings), and oxygen requirement in the Respiratory ROS section of the PAEF. Notify the CAPE team of the upcoming pre-op visit, surgery, and admission. Email the Perioperative Care Coordination Clinic (PCCC) charge nurse with the patient's name, MRN, trach/vent status, date of pre-op visit, date of surgery, and facility status.2. Pre-op Visit: For EXT/SDA patients, connect home vent/devices to wall supply. Parent/guardian is responsible for respiratory care during the pre-op visit. On the day of surgery, the patient should bring a ""Go Bag"" including backup trachs the same size and one size smaller than the existing trach, and a home vent for use in POH if 24-hour vent dependent.3. Day of Surgery: The patient should bring their home ventilator to the hospital. Respiratory Therapy (RT) can be reached for any trach or trach/vent issues or concerns. Non-facility, vent-dependent patients remain on their home vent in POH but will switch to a hospital vent if waiting more than 2 hours. Facility, vent-dependent patients are switched to a hospital vent upon arrival in POH.4. Post-Surgery: Non-ICU patients will use their home vent in the PACU; ICU patients will remain on a hospital vent while in the ICU. RT will not assess the patient or provide supplies unless there are active issues or concerns in Pre-Op Holding (POH).5. Discharge Preparation: Caregivers must demonstrate competence with a BCH ventilator education resource and/or the durable medical equipment (DME) respiratory therapist (set-up, routine operation, patient settings, and alarms). RT or RN will review the travel checklist and the contents of a ""Go Bag"" with the caregiver prior to traveling off the floor.These considerations ensure the safety and well-being of trach and trach/vent-dependent patients during the perioperative period.",1,0,0,0,

What are the potential negative outcomes associated with excess free iron in bank blood and how can ultrafiltration be used to correct this issue before transfusion,"Excess free iron in bank blood can lead to negative outcomes due to increased cell wall fragility and hemolysis after processing and during bypass. This can cause non-physiologic values for many electrolytes, leading to undesirable effects on hemodynamics once the blood is transfused.To correct this issue, ultrafiltration can be used before transfusion. This process involves transferring heparinized plasmalyte to the blood bag, then directing the filtered blood from the bag to the ultrafiltration circuit and returning it to the blood bag. This method helps control the electrolytes and lactate level in the patient's circulating blood volume, reducing the risk of potential negative outcomes associated with excess free iron.Prebypass ultrafiltration is also recommended for patients requiring a blood prime in the bypass circuit. Guidelines suggest that when priming with exogenous blood, the use of prebypass ultrafiltration or washed red blood cells should be used during the priming procedure. This helps meet the standard of correcting any physiologic abnormalities before the initiation of bypass.In summary, ultrafiltration is a method used to correct known issues with bank blood before transfusion, helping to reduce the potential negative outcomes associated with excess free iron.",1,0,0,0,
Why is it important to verify termination of a pregnancy before proceeding with a planned procedure for a patient who has recently terminated a pregnancy,"It is important to verify the termination of a pregnancy before proceeding with a planned procedure for a patient who has recently terminated a pregnancy to ensure the patient's safety and to avoid potential complications. According to the BCH Anesthesia Clinical Guidelines & Policies, patients who have had a termination of pregnancy within 6 weeks before surgery should not be scheduled for elective surgery due to persistent elevation in ßHCG levels and the need for resolution of maternal physiologic changes of pregnancy to the pre-pregnancy state. For patients who have had a recent termination of pregnancy (greater than 6 weeks and within 3 months of a scheduled surgical procedure), a written note from the clinician who performed the termination must be obtained to document any complications and verify that the termination was complete. Additionally, for patients who have had a medical termination of pregnancy with mifepristone/misoprostol, the clinician responsible for the termination must document that the termination was complete with either a follow-up ultrasound or ßHCG level. All female patients must have a ßHCG obtained before undergoing a surgical procedure. If a patient cannot follow up with their clinician prior to surgery, a ßHCG level can be used to verify termination. If the ßHCG level is greater than 5 mIU/mL, the case will need to be cancelled, and the patient will need an evaluation by the gynecologist who performed the termination. Regardless of the method of termination, ßHCG levels are an acceptable way to verify pregnancy termination.",1,0,0,0,
What is the protocol for the Primary Provider if something unexpected occurs during a procedure intervention or treatment,"The primary provider is required to discuss the procedure, intervention, or treatment with the patient and/or the parent/guardian before starting, unless there is a medical emergency.

What items must be accounted for and documented during interventional radiology procedures,"During interventional radiology procedures, the following items must be accounted for and documented:1. Soft goods: Recording counts of soft goods on pre-printed count sheets. Sponges are counted audibly and viewed concurrently as they are completely separated. If the package contains an incorrect number of sponges, it should be bagged, labeled, and isolated.2. Sharps and miscellaneous items: Account for sharps and other miscellaneous items that are opened onto the sterile field. Count all suture needles, regardless of size, for all surgical procedures. If a sharp or miscellaneous item is passed or dropped from the sterile field, the RN circulator should retrieve it using standard precautions, show it to the scrub person, isolate it from the field, and include it in the final count.3. Instruments: Team will conduct a baseline instrument count for all procedures in which a body cavity is entered, all laparoscopic, thorascopic and robotic procedures to establish a baseline. Individual pieces of assembled instruments are counted separately.4. Controlled substances: The name and total dosage amount of all schedule II, III, and IV Controlled Substances taken on each transport must be documented on the Transport Database, and their use, wastage, and unused return is accounted for on the Transport Database according to the Patient Care Manual: Controlled Substances.5. Documenting count activities: The RN circulator and scrub person should document count activities. The surgeon should communicate placement of surgical items into the wound or into a body cavity, orifice, or to the perioperative team for notation in a visible location. The surgeon should perform a methodical wound exploration before closing the wound, using both visualization and touch when feasible, and communicate items left intentionally as packing.6. Count reconciliation activities: The RN circulator, scrub person, and surgeon should participate in count reconciliation activities.7. Counts are not performed during critical phases of a procedure (e.g., time outs, critical dissection, opening of implants, induction/emergence from anesthesia, specimen reconciliation).8. Avoid altering countable items (whenever possible): Team members at the surgical field should communicate any items that have been altered (e.g., intentionally cut). During the subsequent counts, items should be accounted for in their entirety.9. If a broken item is returned from the surgical site, the scrub person will immediately notify the surgical team.10. A scrub person will visually inspect all surgical items as they are passed back from the field that may have broken or become separated within the confines of the surgical site.These procedures ensure the accuracy of image interpretation, improve diagnostic performance, and maintain patient safety during interventional radiology procedures.",1,0,0,0,

Standard Precautions: These are applied to all patients, regardless of their diagnosis or presumed infection status. They are designed to reduce the risk of transmission of microorganisms from both recognized and unrecognized sources of infection. These precautions apply to blood, all body fluids (except sweat and tears), non-intact skin, and mucous membranes.2. Use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Healthcare staff are required to use appropriate PPE, such as gowns and gloves, when dealing with situations that may involve the risk of infection transmission, such as contact with pressure ulcers, draining wounds, uncontrolled secretions, stool incontinence, and ostomy bags.3. Transmission-Based Precautions: These are used in addition to Standard Precautions when a patient is known or suspected to be infected with microorganisms that can be spread by airborne, droplet, or contact transmission.4. Management of Patients with Multidrug-Resistant Organisms (MDRO): For patients known to harbor MDROs, Contact Precautions are used in certain settings, while Standard Precautions are used in others.

How often should a consent be reviewed and updated for outpatient services and under what circumstances would a new consent be required for recurrent treatments and procedures,"For outpatient services, a consent remains valid throughout the course of continuing services, as long as the patient is continuing the same or similar recommended procedure, intervention, or treatment for the same initial diagnosis. However, it is generally recommended that a consent should be reviewed and updated on an annual basis to determine if the course of treatment or evaluation being provided has changed since the initial consent was signed.A new consent may not be required for each recurrent treatment or procedure, unless there is a significant deviation from the original plan, the patient's condition or diagnosis changes from the initial intent of the consent, or different treatments are being provided during the recurring treatment plan.In summary, the frequency of reviewing and updating consent for outpatient services is typically annual, while a new consent is necessary when there are significant changes in the treatment plan or the patient's condition.",1,0,0,0,
What is the process for handling a transport request in terms of communication responsibilities for the Communications Specialist,"The Communications Specialist (CS) plays a central role in handling a transport request. Initially, the CS takes the transport request and relays the information to the Transport Team, the Medical Control Physician, and the referring facility. The CS who initiates the transport request is responsible for communicating with the team throughout the transport process.If the CS handling a transport request receives another call, they should put the new call on hold and prioritize the transport request. If another CS is available, they can take over the new call, allowing the first CS to focus on the transport request.All calls related to the transport request should be made through a dedicated transport phone line to ensure proper recording and free use of the line. The CS's role also includes connecting the referring provider with the appropriate Medical Control Physician and the Crew Chief for report, minimizing the time the referring provider is on hold.In special cases, like a Mobile ECMO request, the CS takes the initial information and notifies the appropriate team members. If the Medical Control Physician and the referring physician agree that the response time of the Critical Care Transport Team is inadequate, the CS is responsible for making other arrangements for transport on behalf of the referring physician.At the start of each day and overnight shift, the CS logs into Care Connect to determine which Medical Control Physician will be receiving transport requests for the shift, ensuring efficient communication.",1,0,0,0,

How should nurses handle the related content processes when encountering them during their shift,"Based on the sources provided, the query ""How should nurses handle related content processes during their shift"" seems to be most closely addressed by sources 1, 2, and 3. Here's a simplified response:Nurses should handle content processes during their shift by following the staffing plans developed based on the American Nurses Association (ANA) principles of Nurse Staffing. These principles address patient care, staff, and institutional activities.Patient care activities should reflect the needs of the patients. The staffing plan considers the number of patients, the level of care required, and incorporates physical and psychosocial limitations.For staff-related activities, the needs of the patient populations determine the competencies required of the nurses. Staff skill mix and competencies, along with leadership and organizational support, guide this process.Nurses work in shifts (usually 8 or 12 hours) to provide maximum support for patient flow. The charge nurse from the off-going shift picks the assignment with input from the staff nurses based on experience, consistency, and the mix of acuity of each patient. The use of tools like the CAMEO is utilized to guide assignment making.In addition, the Synergy Model of care is used to match individual nurse competencies with patient needs when assigning patients. This model emphasizes providing continuity of care with a family-centered approach.Please note that the specific processes may vary depending on the hospital's policies and the specific unit the nurse is working in. The sources provided do not give detailed information about handling specific content processes, but they do provide a general framework for how nurses should approach their shifts and patient care.",1,0,0,0,"1,2,3"

How does the MetaNeb System help in preventing or resolving patchy atelectasis,"The MetaNeb System is a therapy that can help prevent or resolve patchy atelectasis. This is done by enhancing the removal of secretions from the lungs. The effectiveness of this therapy is evaluated by observing changes in the patient's lung sounds, respiration rate and depth, as well as heart rate. If a patient responds positively to MetaNeb therapy, it is recommended to continue on a schedule of two or four times a day. The therapy is no longer needed when the patient shows a reduction in secretions, a clearance or significant improvement in bilateral breath sounds, or becomes ambulatory.

What is the role of ECMO in the MSICU Clinical Practice Guideline,"The role of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) in the MSICU Clinical Practice Guideline is to support patients with cardiac and/or respiratory failure who do not respond to conventional treatments. ECMO is a modified cardiopulmonary bypass circuit designed for extended use. It can be applied electively or urgently, and when instituted during cardiac arrest, it's referred to as Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (ECPR).The clinical management of patients requiring ECMO support is handled by a multidisciplinary team, with the technical aspects managed by specially trained Registered Respiratory Therapists known as ECMO Specialists. ECMO is primarily initiated in the MSICU, but may also be started in other locations like the OR or Cardiac Catheterization Lab. However, it's recommended to transfer patients who are candidates for ECMO to the MSICU for treatment, as it's a location with personnel experienced in the procedure.The decision to activate ECMO, as well as the determination of location for cannulation, is made by the MSICU critical care attending physician in conjunction with the general surgery attending. In the OR, this decision can be made by the anesthesiology attending physician along with a general surgery attending. For locations outside of the MSICU or OR, the request for ECMO should be communicated directly by an attending physician to the MSICU critical care attending, who will then activate CODE ECMO to the appropriate location and direct the requesting physician to continue high quality CPR while transporting the patient.",1,0,0,0,
