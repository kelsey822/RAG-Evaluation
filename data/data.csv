What are the steps the medical team should take if an infant has not had a hearing screening at the birth hospital or requires a repeat screen as per the hospital policy,0,"The MD/NP determines if the infant's hearing screen was completed at the birth hospital. If the infant has not had a hearing screening at the birth hospital or if the infant requires a repeat screen as determined by the guidelines in this policy, the medical team: • informs the parent/legal guardian of the significance of the hearing screenings. • contacts Audiology (ext 5-6461 or via Newborn Hearing Screen Request in EHR) to alert of the need for the screening prior to discharge. The Audiology Assistant performs the hearing screen. The Audiologist: • Reports normal results in patient chart (paper, if applicable, and in EHR) and communicates results to the parent/legal guardian. If the parent/legal guardian is not available, results are conveyed via telephone and/or postal mail. • Reports abnormal results to the medical team and to the parent/legal guardian, and documents results in the EHR. A member of the medical team and/or the audiologist discusses with the parent/legal guardian abnormal results, the result implications, and need for further testing. The Audiologist gives a list of DPH-approved diagnostic test centers to the parent/legal guardian and instructs him/her to make a follow-up diagnostic audiological evaluation appointment at an approved test center. If the infant does not pass the hearing test prior to discharge, the nurse documents that the follow-up appointment has been scheduled on the Newborn Hearing Screening Test Result form located in the ""consults"" section of the patient's chart. • If the follow-up appointment has not been scheduled, the nurse assists the parent/legal guardian with this process and documents the time and date of the appointment on the appropriate line of the form.","1. Massachusetts requires all newborns to receive a hearing screening by three months of age, unless the parent/guardian objects to a screen based on sincerely held religious beliefs 2. Hearing Screening must occur at the birth hospital before initial discharge to home or at a referring hospital (if the newborn is directly transferred from the birth hospital) before initially discharged to home a. BCH clinicians should obtain and document in the patient's chart information from the transferring hospital if a hearing screen was performed and the results of such screen. If the screen was not successful, missed, or the infant did not pass prior to the transfer, BCH shall conduct the screen prior to initial discharge to home. b. BCH clinicians must notify the parent(s)/guardian(s) both orally and in writing if a heaing screening was not successful, missed, or the infant did not pass. If a repeat or further screening cannot occur prior to discharge, the parent(s)/guardian(s) should be informed in writing of the inability to test prior to discharge, and the following should occur: i. Notify the infant's primary care provider; and ii. An appointment should be made at a DPH approved screening center such as BCH (note based on lack of availability of appointments at available locations, parents can also be provided with a list of sites that conduct such diagnostic screening for their choice). 3. If an infant cannot be screened due to delayed physiological development or physiological instability (related to but not limited to an illness or premature birth) as determined by the treating clinician, the infant shall be screened prior to discharge and as early as the identified physiological development or stability will permit reliable screening. 4. If the infant is discharged to home prior to conducting the hearing screen, an appointment is made for a screen to be performed within 1 month of the infants birth (note based on lack of availability of appointments at available locations, parents can also be provided with a list of sites that conduct such diagnostic screening for their choice). a. The infant's primary care provider should be notified that a hearing screen is pending. Re-screening 5. The Joint Committee on Infant Hearing (JCIH) recommends a repeat hearing screen prior to discharge for infants with conditions/complications associated with potential hearing loss. a. Conditions that warrant re-screening include, but are not limited to, history of ECMO, bilirubin level >20 and/or hyperbilirubinemia requiring an exchange transfusion, gentamicin dosing>72 hrs, furosemide>7 doses, culture-positive sepsis, and meningitis.","1. If BCH is not aware that a newborn blood sample was collected at the birth hospital or was obtained prior to 24 hours of age, a blood sample will be taken between 24-48 hours after birth for all inpatient newborn admissions. 2. The admitting nurse is responsible for verifying if any blood specimens were collected on newborns prior to admission to Boston Children's Hospital, or indicating that such information was not provided so the appropriate collection will occur during the BCH admission. 3. In addition to the initial specimen collected within 24-48 hours of birth on all infants, BCH will also collect repeat specimens according to the following timeframes as a general standard of care for all newborns who are treated for inpatient level services: a. For patients in Intensive Care Units: i. 14 days; ii. 1 month of age; and iii. monthly thereafter at the discretion of the prescriber. b. For patients in non-ICU setting: i. Newborn Blood Screens will be ordered at the discretion of the prescriber based on an abnormal Newborn Screening, or the clinical presentation and admitting diagnosis. 4. Operational Considerations : a. Obtain specimens prior to a blood transfusion or dialysis to prevent masking clinically significant test results. i. If the infant is transfused within 48 hours of specimen collection, a repeat specimen should be obtained 48 hours post transfusion. b. If the infant will be discharged to another facility, notify the receiving hospital when the most recent specimen was obtained. c. If there is a clinical concern about hypothyroidism, testing can be performed sooner than the standard intervals. d. Repeat specimens are collected immediately if the New England Newborn Screening Program at the Massachusetts State Lab reports abnormal results or indicates that a specimen is unsatisfactory for any reason. e. Urgent results are faxed or mailed to Boston Children's Hospital and must be reported immediately to the newborn's treating provider for appropriate follow-up.","Massachusetts defines ""newborn infant"" for purposes of the hearing screen as an infant under three months of age and the term ""hearing screen"" is a test to detect hearing thresholds of 30 decibels or greater in the speech frequency range in either ear. Screening is conducted as soon as the infant is medically stable and prior to initial discharge to home. In exceptional circumstances related to medical acuity as determined by the infant's physician/nurse practitioner (MD/NP), the hearing screen is completed no later than three months of age.","Complete patient care documentation as described in the Patient Care Manual.

Who should be notified in the event of a formal HICS activation and how will they be notified,0,"When Emergency Management on Call identifies that a predicted weather event may impact hospital operations (including satellite sites), Emergency Management on Call will initiate planning activities with members of the Hospital Command Group (HCG). Initial notification will be sent out 48 hours prior to a forecasted severe weather event, whenever possible. Based on this discussion and the weather forecast, the Administrator On Duty (AOD), assuming the role of Incident Commander, may decide to activate HICS and/or open the Hospital Command Center. A pre-event planning checklist may be used. If necessary, the Chief Operating Officer, in collaboration with the AOD, will make the determination to close ambulatory clinics. Senior Leadership Communication: • The AOD, or designee, will notify SCLC of any formal HICS activation or discussions to modify operations. Daily SCLC SBAR emails will be distributed as needed during the activation.","To provide for the coordination of hospital and community resources during an emergency response, BCH has adopted the Hospital Incident Command System which has been modified to fit the unique operational structure of the organization while maintaining the overall structure and naming conventions set forth by National Incident Management System (NIMS). This scalable command structure is based on an ""all hazards"" approach. Its primary purpose is to provide administrative command and control (i.e. coordination and support) for all hospital resources dedicated to the response effort and to establish effective communication and coordination with external response agencies to facilitate the maintenance of hospital operations. BCH uses a single HICS model to support all satellite locations. Through the use of a Hospital Administration Medical Technical Specialist, remote site leaders ""plug into"" the single HICS system. Note: BCH's Waltham Inpatient is a position on the Inpatient Team and the other satellites are represented on the Outpatient Team. When necessary, BCH will activate HICS and open the Hospital Command Center. Based on the available information, the decision to initiate the response phase of emergency management is made by the Administrator on Duty (AOD). The AOD who activates HICS assumes the role of Incident Commander (IC). If the AOD is not on site, the Coordinator of Patient Placement (COPP) may be requested to fulfill a temporary Deputy IC role until the AOD arrives. Deputy IC responsibilities include providing situational awareness, updates, and other duties as assigned until the AOD arrives. The IC, based on specific circumstances of the event, will activate any and all appropriate Command and General Staff positions. An IC is always identified for every actual or potential event, and other portions of HICS may or may not be activated. All staff with the potential to fill a role on the HICS organization chart have been offered training on IS 100, 200, and 700 and a BCH custom HICS course. In this training, attendees are taught that they report solely to their immediate supervisor as outlined in the HICS structure (or ""unity of command""). If they are not serving in a HICS role, they continue to report to their regularly designated supervisor, manager or director. At the core of the BCH HICS structure is an organizational chart, which outlines the responder role reporting structure (or ""chain of command""). Each HICS position has a Job Action Sheet (JAS). The JAS serves as a checklist of duties to be accomplished in priority sequence. HICS is used in the management of every emergency event, regardless of size. Only positions that are necessary for the event are activated, and positions may be activated or deactivated at any time. Assignments to various roles may change over the course of the event. The AOD is initially notified of a potential event through the hospital paging system, e-mail, phone, and/or internal notification. Staff who may initiate the notification can include, but are not limited to: Emergency Department, Risk Management, Security, Engineering, Emergency Management, Infection Prevention & Control (IPC), Information Services Department (ISD), Clinical Education and Informatics (CEI), Ambulatory Clinics, and Satellite leadership. All staff are empowered to escalate concerns to the AOD directly, if necessary. On-duty staff members may be notified of a potential event via overhead page, digital group pagers (some of which ring to mobile phones), Connect Messenger, or e-mail ( see Communications Matrix ). A disaster hot-line number is also available for staff to call for additional information. Off-duty staff members who are needed for the emergency response may be notified via personal pager, telephone, cell phone, and/ or e-mail. Each BCH department is responsible for maintaining an emergency call list of their staff members. Off-site physicians are notified of a potential event via their Directors or Chiefs. Physicians' HICS positions will be filled as deemed necessary by the AOD using available staff. Upon notification of a HICS assignment, staff members will report to the Hospital Command Center (HCC) (or established conference call line) to receive their specific job assignments, relevant documentation, and disaster identification (if required). As appointments are made, some appointees will be required to make additional appointments in accordance with the HICS organization chart and distribute appropriate HICS materials. Each individual will fulfill the responsibilities as listed on his/her JAS. During the implementation of HICS, a record of position assignments and the person assuming the role is maintained in the HCC. HICS activations require that staff assuming a HICS role ""sign in"" at the HCC to help maintain staff accountability and clarity of assigned roles.

How can zero balance ultrafiltration ZBUF in bloodprimed CRRT circuits help achieve electrolyte and acidbase homeostasis prior to patient connection and what are the implications for patient care,1,"• The use of blood products in the extracorporeal circuit is dictated by patient need, physician consultation and policy guidelines. • The use of other blood products, such as plasma and platelets (rarely) in the bypass circuit is dictated by the attending surgeon and/or anesthesiologist. • Refer to guidelines Bypass Prime Selection (2.6), Priming the Perfusion Circuit (2.7) and Cell Saver Washing of Blood for Bypass Primes (2.14) for additional information. • Conventional and zero balance ultrafiltration must be considered when administering bank blood and to control the electrolytes and lactate level in the patient's circulating blood volume. • All blood products are irradiated (PRBCs are also leukoreduced) before they are sent to the CVOR. This is an important consideration in the prevention of graft versus host disease and significant morbidity or even mortality. While this practice leads to potassium leak from the cells, it is generally considered acceptable to do this up to 18 hours in advance. Our Blood Bank practice typically has irradiation done <6 hours before dispense and so the potassium increase should be minimal (1). • There is a laminated Suspected Transfusion Reaction guidance document hanging on every anesthesia machine. The Blood Bank must be notified (5-6260 or 5-4166, or pager 6260) if a transfusion reaction is suspected so that a Blood Bank physician can advise on next steps. • Refer to PolicyStat document, Transfusion of Blood or Blood Components, for information regarding product verification and transfusion practice. • Recommendations for minimum acceptable hematocrit levels for different patient populations are listed in the chart below.","Bank blood is known to have nonphysiologic values for many electrolytes which can lead to an undesirable effect on hemodynamics once transfused (1-4). Cell saver washing of PRBC units has been shown to effectively control mediators of hemodynamic change seen with stored blood (2,5). Though, increased cell wall fragility and hemolysis after processing and during bypass may be seen (5,6). This can lead to excess free iron in the blood which has been associated with negative outcomes (7-12). Prebypass ultrafiltration can be used to correct known issues with bank blood for patients requiring a blood prime in the bypass circuit (13-16). Standard 13.2 in the 2019 AmSECT Pediatric and Congenital Standards and Guidelines states that, ""When priming with exogenous blood, a circuit prime gas and electrolyte levels shall be obtained prior to initiation of bypass and adjustments made to correct any physiologic abnormalities"" is a standard which shall be perfomred (17). Additionally, guidelines 13.1 and 13.2 state that. ""When priming with exogenous blood, the use of prebypass ultrafiltration (preBUF) or washed red blood cells should be used during priming procedure"" and ""the perfusionist should consider matching prime composition to the individual patient values"" (17). These two guidelines should be given strong consideration. The PBUF policy aims to meet the standard and if indicated, the guidelines as well.","1. Complete the patient slip including: ◦ Patient weight, height, Hct, allergy history, blood type ◦ Preoperative diagnosis, pertinent history, and surgical plan ◦ Name of attending surgeon 2. Print the latest cath or Echo report from Heart Center Scene or Powerchart and attach to the patient slip. 3. Complete the Pump Data Sheet and print. 4. Using the Oxygenator and Tubing Pack Selection charts to choose the components that best fit the planned procedure taking into account the patient history. Consult team members and planned primary perfusionist for circuits at the limits for a given situation. 5. The following set up standards should be used when selecting circuit components in advance of the day of surgery. Active Ultrafiltration Only : means that we are using the sixth pump head with a boot line connecting the venous limb to the hemoconcentrator. The hemoconcentrator outlet is connected to a valved purge line and runs to the CVR. This set up also allows for passive ultrafiltration during CPB. MUF Set Up : means that we are using an active ultrafiltration setup with the hemoconcentrator outlet connected to the arterial pump boot line. * An active ultrafiltration option is available for all circuits. This option minimizes the obligate shunts in a perfusion circuit which may impact effective forward flow. The Terumo CDI shunt line is typically the only obligate shunt when active ultrafiltration is set up for a circuit. Infant Packs : All cases set up for MUF, regardless of surgeon. Toddler Packs : All cases set up for MUF, regardless of surgeon. Child Packs : • 1/4"" boot cases (generally, BSA <0.7) are set up for MUF, regardless of surgeon. • 3/8"" boot cases are set up for active ultrafiltration only (with option for passive UF) but may be set up for MUF based on surgeon or perfusionist preference. Adult Packs : Traditional passive ultrafiltration set up only. These circuits may include active ultrafiltration with the use of a ""MUF pack"".","1. Moore Gl, Peck CC, Sohmer PR, Zuck TF.

Research not involving greater than minimal risk. There is no greater than minimal risk to children. The IRB only needs to ensure that the study has appropriately obtained the consent of the DCF social worker managing the child's case. 2. Researcher involving greater than minimal risk with a prospect of direct benefit. There is more than minimal risk to children, but either the intervention or procedure holds the prospect of direct benefit for the individual subject, or a monitoring procedure will likely contribute to the subject's well- being. Then the IRB should determine: a. The risk is justified by the anticipated benefit to the subjects; b. The relation of the anticipated benefit to the risk is at least as favorable to the subjects as that presented by available alternative approaches; and c. the study will appropriately obtain the consent of the DCF social worker managing the child's case. 3. Research involving greater than minimal risk and no prospect of direct benefit to individual subject, but likely to yield generalizable knowledge about the subject's disorder or condition. There is more than minimal risk to children, but the intervention or procedure does not hold out the prospect of direct benefit for the individual subject. The IRB should determine: a. The risk represents a minor increase over minimal risk; b. The intervention or procedure presents experiences to subjects that are reasonably commensurate with those inherent in their actual or expected medical, dental, psychological, social, or educational situations; c. The intervention or procedure is likely to yield generalizable knowledge about the subjects' disorder or condition which is of vital importance for the understanding or amelioration of the subjects' disorder or condition; and d. the study will appropriately obtain the consent of the DCF social worker managing the child's case. Federal requirements also place two specific requirements on children in state custody (again for Massachusetts this is limited to situations where DCF has placed a child in a C&P) participating in research involving greater than minimal risk and no prospect of direct benefit to individual subject: 1. Children in state custody may be included in research that presents greater than minimal risk with no prospect of direct benefit only if the IRB determines and documents that such research is: a. Related to their status as wards; or b. Conducted in schools, camps, hospital, institutions, or similar settings in which the majority of children involved as participants are not wards 2. If the IRB approves the enrollment in a study per #1 above, then in addition to consent obtained from the DCF social worker managing the child's case, the study will also need to appoint an advocate for any child in the state agency's custody. The advocate must be an individual (in addition to the DCF social worker managing the case) who has the background and experience to act in, and agrees to act in, the best interests of the child for the duration of the child's participation in the research. The advocate must not be associated with the research, the investigator(s), or DCF. Advocates may be a member of the IRB or a dedicated person hired to be the central advocate for any research participants within this risk category As applicable, the meeting minutes, reviewer documentation, and determination letters will document the IRB protocol specific findings related to research involving children in state custody.","1.

Social stories specific to Boston Children's Hospital are accessible via the External Web. ▪ To access: go to the External Web → Centers and Services → Autism Spectrum Center → Resources → My Hospital Stay. There are social stories with pictures for a pre-op visit, labs draws, overnight stays, etc.. Please consult CL for additional resources. ◦ Patients with ASD are often concrete, visual learners. When giving directions, use ""First/Then"" language. ◦ Utilize coping/distraction items (e.g. iPad, chewy toys) whenever available • During chart review, identify patient with ASD and note the following: ◦ Has the patient had a BRT evaluation in the past? If so, is there a current (<1 year old) BRT Behavior Plan in place? ◦ Has the patient been evaluated by Psych for comorbidities? ◦ Has the patient tolerated prior hospitalizations and/or surgical procedures? Was anything particularly challenging? Were any strategies/interventions particularly helpful? • Contact the parent/guardian/caregiver to obtain additional information. Use the following screening questions from CL/BRT as a guide: ◦ How does the patient communicate? ◦ Does the patient have sensory sensitivity to touch, noise, light, too many people, etc.? If so, what helps? ◦ How does the patient react to pain? ◦ What situations trigger/upset the patient? ◦ How does the patient react when upset or agitated? (e.g. kicking, yelling, throwing things, biting, withdrawal, self harm) ◦ How do you calm the patient? (e.g. explanation/information, distraction, quiet space, music, iPad) ◦ Does the patient have an awareness of safety or a history of bolting/fleeing in an attempt to cope? ◦ How does the patient cope with transitions and schedule changes? ◦ What have prior hospitalizations been like for the patient? ◦ Is there anything else we need to know to care for the patient? ◦ Is the parent/caregiver interested in a BRT consult at the pre-op visit? ▪ No: Document if the parent/caregiver denies behavior issues and/or declines a BRT consult. ▪ Yes: Email BRT-DL and the Perioperative Care Coordination Clinic (PCCC) Child Life Specialist (CLS). Document on the PAEF if BRT plans to meet with the family in the PCCC (include pager #) or call the family at home. ◦ If applicable, is the current BRT Behavior Plan still accurate? • Include anesthesiologist Dr. Bistra Vlassakova on emails regarding patients with Behavior Plans • For all patients with ASD and/or documented behavioral issues, notify the PCCC CLS. The CLS will flag the sign-in sheet in the PCCC, notify the Administrative Assistant (AA) staff that the visit should be expedited, and alert the Clinical Assistant staff to potential behavioral challenges when obtaining vital signs, labs, etc.. • Note on the patient's paper chart if a private room is needed upon arrival in the PCCC and/or Pre-Op Holding • Notify CL in advance if pre-op labs are needed • Utilize CL for distraction as needed • Document presence of a BRT plan and other considerations (e.g. private room if patient may be disruptive to others, etc.) on the PAEF Special Needs List • Notify AA staff if Behavioral Precautions are indicated • BRT consult not indicated for patients with high functioning autism who are well-managed • See algorithm below for visual representation:","• How to access external records via portals ◦ See the following document for detailed steps: http://web2.tch.harvard.edu/champs/Documents/ How_Do_I_External_Portals_with_Tufts_v3.pdf • How to troubleshoot when a portal is not displayed ◦ There are 6 demographic details that have to match up between the BCH record and the external portal ◦ If there is a discrepancy in any of those 6 details (e.g. address, zip code, spelling of name), then BCH employees will not have access to the external portal ◦ If you believe you should see a portal link for your patient, but it is not displayed in PowerChart/ SurgiNet, or no patient match is found, contact mypatients@childrens.harvard.edu and provide the following information about the patient: ▪ Name ▪ DOB ▪ BCH MRN ▪ Gender ▪ Name of external portal (MGB, Tufts, PPOC, Atrius, SSHS)",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0

What are the steps involved in preparing a patient for the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test MWT procedure,1,"1. In preparation, the clinician and the patient should define goals for adequate sleep regarding timing and duration. 2. Adequate sleep should be documented by sleep diary and, whenever possible, actigraphy for 2 weeks before testing. 3. The MWT should be conducted when a patient is clinically stable and when treatments of any known sleep disorders are well-established and effective. 4. In patients with sleep-disordered breathing who are being evaluated for the effectiveness of therapy, the clinician should ensure effectiveness (efficacy and adherence) based on a review of downloaded data or self-reported use for non-PAP before testing. If adequate effectiveness is suboptimal, then the clinician should determine if the anticipated impact on the test results warrants rescheduling. The patient should use PAP/non-PAP therapy on the night before the MWT. 5. The clinician should develop a plan regarding the use of prescription medications, OTC agents, herbal remedies, and other substances. If the patient is chronically taking medications with alerting or sedating properties, then they should be continued at a stable dose. Changes in medications should be avoided for 2 weeks before testing. The patient should be instructed to consult with the clinician before starting a prescription or OTC medication before the test. 6. The patient's use of tobacco, caffeine and medications before and during MWT should be determined by the sleep clinician before the MWT. The patient should abstain from alcohol, marijuana, and other sedating substances on the day of the test. Drug screening may be indicated to ensure that sleepiness or wakefulness during the MWT is not influenced by substances other than medically prescribed drugs. The physician may request a urine specimen for drug screening; the timing of this specimen is determined by the physician. 7. Relevant clinical data such as preceding sleep schedules, PAP adherence, or other therapies should be available to the interpreting clinician. The MWT should be performed after the patient's major sleep period. Performance of a PSG before the MWT is at the discretion of the sleep clinician","The sleep facility performs MWTs in accordance with AASM practice parameters and published guidelines. MWT is indicated to assess a person's ability to remain awake when his or her inability to remain awake constitutes a public or personal safety issue. MWT may be indicated in patients with excessive daytime sleepiness to assess response to treatment. MWT must be ordered or approved by an appropriately licensed facility medical staff member. The need to perform a PSG prior to MWT is determined by the staff physician based on clinical circumstances. MWT trials last 40 minutes. On occasion the staff physician may order 20-minute trials (e.g., for FAA requirements).","A standard MWT protocol that is consistent with AASM practice parameters promotes consistency, allows comparisons between tests, and ensures accurate interpretations that are consistent with published data.

EXAMPLE: 51kg x 60= 3060= 3100mLs","This guidance provides guidelines for investigators to consider when designing a protocol that involves drawing blood from human subjects for research* purposes. * For research conducted under approval by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) IRB you may follow the DFCI IRB blood drawing guidelines. • Up to 5% of the whole blood volume may be removed over an 8-week period, on a single occasion or in divided portions, from human subjects in good health and with a hematocrit of not less than the low normal value for age. • Additional volumes of blood may be removed in subsequent 8-week periods using the same criteria, if the subject remains in good health and maintains a hematocrit level of not less than the low normal value for age. • If blood samples for research purposes are to be obtained at the same time a clinical sample is drawn, or if it is expected that additional clinical samples will be taken during the 8-week period, the total amount of blood (research and clinical) should not exceed 5% of whole blood volume, unless specifically approved by the IRB. For this reason, investigators must know and take into consideration clinically indicated blood drawing requirements for potential subjects. • The amount of blood drawn should be limited to that needed to meet the goals of the particular study. • Whenever the volume of blood to be removed will exceed 1% of whole blood volume of the subject, hematocrit should be checked in advance to determine that it is not less than the low normal value for age. The frequency of monitoring hematocrit levels should be commensurate with the volume of blood to be removed, and the estimated vulnerability of the subject to blood loss. • If a subject may not be in good health, and in particular, has a cardiovascular, pulmonary or hematopoietic problem, the volume of blood to be removed should be adjusted accordingly. • If the study protocol necessitates that the volume of blood to be removed exceeds the above criteria recommended for subjects in good health, or that the volume cannot be reduced in consideration of poor health or low hematocrit level, the IRB will consider approving the project only if the added risk can be justified by the expected direct benefit to the subjects. • Whenever possible, blood should be taken at the same time that a clinically indicated blood draw is performed. • The estimated volume and frequency of blood to be removed, risks associated with blood removal, and the measures to be taken to minimize those risks should be included in the research consent form. • Measures to minimize the risk of a potential reaction to a blood draw should be taken. Such measures may include the following: ◦ Research staff should make sure that subjects have eaten and had something to drink before a blood draw. ◦ Subjects should be asked to remain in the blood draw area for at least 10 minutes after a blood draw. They should be encouraged to drink, eat, and report symptoms and should be observed for any problems. ◦ A nurse or trained health care provider should always be on site to deal with any reactions. ◦ Use of EMLA cream is recommended to minimize pain (optional).","Generally 80mL of PRBC will be placed in the burette and the volume of albumin added will depend on the hematocrit of the PRBC unit. Below is an example with a unit having a hematocrit of 78% and using a final desired hematocrit of 40% for the blood albumin prime solution. Example Therefore, you add 76mL of albumin 5% to 80mL of PRBCs in the burette to is equal get a blood/albumin mixture to 156mL with a hematocrit of 40%. 156mL-80mL = 76mL","1.

Hospital Ambulatory Services: These include the dialysis program, infusion center, ambulatory procedure units, and similar settings, but not physician offices where services are billed by Foundations (e.g. Fegan building and similar office settings). Treatment of a patient over the age of 35 in a hospital ambulatory service requires the approval of Department or Division Chief (in consultation with the responsible ACNO when appropriate), or other specifically delegated departmental leader if the Chief is unavailable. 6. Once a patient over the age of 35 is approved for admission/treatment, subsequent admissions/ treatments within the next 2-years do not require individual approval. 7. Patients over the age of 35 may be admitted from the Emergency Department or another setting for urgent conditions without prior approval of the Chief if, in the judgment of the admitting physician, the patient meets the criteria for admission under this policy and, therefore, would be otherwise approved. 8. Emergency Department: Any patient over the age of 21 should be treated for the purpose of stabilizing and transferring the patient to an adult care facility unless the patient is then currently a patient of Boston Children's Hospital or being treated for a pediatric condition or is under the care of a Boston Children's Hospital physician or a network physician. ER physicians may treat persons over the age of 21 for minor conditions capable of resolution within the ER rather than transferring to an adult ER service. 9. Ancillary, Consulting, and Diagnostic Services: Unless determined to be unsafe, once a patient is admitted to BCH, or seen in a Hospital Ambulatory Service, all ancillary, consulting, and diagnostic medical services will be available for the treatment of the patient. This includes radiologic services provided consistent with Guidelines for Radiologic Services [link]. 10. In making a determination whether to admit a patient or groups of patients with certain diagnoses over the age of 21, the following factors must be taken into account. a. The patient has a condition that is appropriately treated at BCH, provided that the patient poses no danger to pediatric patients, and b. No such patient occupies a bed in the same room as a pediatric patient, and c. The hospital keeps a log of each such admission, which is available for inspection by the Department of Public Health. 11. An adult medicine consultation (e.g., Weitzman Family Bridges Adult Transition Program, pager 2382) is recommended for inpatients over age 21. 12. Once a patient has been transferred to an adult facility, in general these patients transition their admissions, consultations, emergency care, and ancillary studies to the adult hospital, except as dictated by the specialized requirements for pediatric disease processes or other appropriate exception. 13. This policy does not apply to ambulatory care rendered in physician offices where services are billed by Foundations (e.g. Fegan building and similar office settings). 14. Any provider or program that provides adult care on a routine basis should ensure that it has the required staff expertise and resources to appropriately care for the patient and complete an assessment upon identification of a substantive programmatic change.",4,4,2,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1

However, placement of the catheter tip into the RA may be acceptable for dialysis and other high-flow indications if adequate flows cannot be established with the tip at the SVC/RA junction. The acceptable location for a CVC catheter tip in patients ≤3 months old (corrected age) is anywhere in the SVC or IVC, but not in the RA unless this is required for high-flow indications (e.g., dialysis) and adequate flows cannot be established at the SVC/RA junction. Other than for high-flow indications, catheters should generally not be left in the RA due to a high risk of line-related complications, and due to the (potentially) high degree of line position variation within the RA during movement and positioning. The acceptable location for a CVC catheter tip in patients >3 months old (corrected age) is anywhere in the SVC, IVC, or in the proximal RA. The proximal RA may be preferable in high-flow indications (e.g., pheresis, dialysis) when inadequate or inconsistent flow is encountered at the SVC/RA junction during intraoperative assessment during placement. Indications for removing the line from the RA include arrhythmia, or radiographic findings that suggest either deformation of the atrial wall by the catheter or projection through the tricuspid valve.","With the exception of contrast-enhanced ultrasound examinations for which contrast orders are written prior to the initiation of the examination, the following process is utilized in the department. • Imaging examinations scheduled in EPIC appear in the ROC for protocoling in RadBoard / Allocade by the Radiologist (authorized prescriber). Unscheduled add-on imaging examinations do not appear within the ROC but are similarly protocoled by the Radiologist in RadBoard / Allocade. ◦ Examinations that always require contrast have the appropriate specific contrast and administration details (eg. Weight-based volume) pre-selected in the protocol or available in a communications drop down menu. ◦ Examinations that do not always require contrast include an optional check box for the specific contrast and administration details along with options for post-contrast imaging acquisitions. • An up-to-date patient weight to be used for contrast administration is determined upon patient arrival in Radiology • For those studies in which the use of contrast is discretionary: ◦ At the time of the imaging examination the Radiologic Technologist (R.T.) confirms with the supervising Radiologist (authorized prescriber) using a RadBoard / Allocade ""drop down"" menu that it is indicated to administer the contrast as protocoled. ◦ The supervising Radiologist, based on the clinical history, indications for exam and/or pre-contrast imaging results, acknowledges the technologist's query on proceeding with contrast administration using an Allocade ""drop down"" menu. • The R.T.transcribes the order for contrast from the Radiologist (authorized prescriber) from RadBoard / Allocade into PowerChart (EHR), with the specific volume of contrast calculated within PowerChart using the dose calculator, and routes the PowerChart order for contrast to the Radiologist for signature. • A Pharmacist reviews the contrast order within PowerChart. • The R.T. or an R.N. administers the specified contrast. • The R.T. documents the contrast details within RadNet radiology information system (RIS). • The R.T. or R.N. documents the administration in PowerChart. • The Radiologist co-signs the PowerChart contrast order.","Body of knowledge that allows the nurse to manage whatever environmental and system resources that exist for the patient and family, within or across healthcare systems.

What are the 2 types of ECMO and what specific support does each type provide,1,"Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is the application of a modified cardiopulmonary bypass circuit designed for long-term use to patients with cardiac and/or respiratory failure who have not responded to conventional measures or treatments. There are 2 types of ECMO, veno-arterial (VA) which provides cardiac and pulmonary support and veno-venous (VV) which provides pulmonary support. Patients on ECMO may be cannulated through the vessels of the neck, groin or via open chest. The BCH CCTT has the capability to transport patients who have been successfully cannulated at the referring facility and are deemed appropriate candidates for transport. BCH does not provide on-site cannulation at referring hospitals.","Purpose To describe the steps for replacing initiating pump-less ECMO. 1. Pump-less ECMO, also referred to as Extracorporeal CO removal (ECCO R), or arterial-venous CO 2 2 2 removal, is the use of a membrane oxygenator in conjunction with an arterial-to-venous cannulation configuration. The patient's native cardiac output provides the driving pressure for the system which results in a blood path of artery-to-membrane-to-vein. The sweep gas of the oxygenator is adjusted to augment CO clearance so that lung-protective ventilation may be assured. Improved oxygenation may 2 be a secondary benefit. 2. The use of pump-less ECMO is considered in patients refractory to maximized mechanical ventilator support with a primary inability to adequately remove CO resulting in persistent and severe respiratory 2 acidosis. 3. Pump-less ECMO is best suited to patients with an adequate cardiac output capable of generating a minimum MAP of > 70 mm Hg, and unobstructed femoral blood vessels. 4. Pump-less ECMO is an alternative to standard ECMO particularly if prolonged support is anticipated for acute-on-chronic disease (e.g. lung transplant candidate w/ BOOP), or in a rapid but quickly reversible process (e.g. severe asthma exacerbation). 5. The decision to use pump-less ECMO is approved by a CICU Attending and Cardiac Surgery Attending, or MSICU Attending and General Surgery Attending. 6. Carefully consider cannula choice. Cannulae smaller than would be used for ECMO may not provide sufficient flow while preserving adequate distal limb perfusion. The smallest available cannulae are 15 Fr. x 18 cm length. 7. Central cannulation may be used to provide right ventricle assist. In this configuration cannulae are tunneled under the sternum and are connected to the MPA and LA, thus bypassing or unloading the RV. This configuration also allows for increased patient mobility and ambulation.","1. The Committee on Clinical Investigation (CCI) must review and approve any payment, monetary or otherwise, offered to a subject or family as part of a research protocol. The Committee on Clinical Investigation will consider the details of remuneration when evaluating the protocol 2. There are no established policies as to the amount and type of payments that may be offered to research subjects and families, as each protocol differs. The CCI recognizes four types of payments: a. reimbursement, b. compensation, c. tokens of appreciation, d. incentives The protocol application and informed consent should describe in detail when the subject will receive the remuneration, what will be provided ( toys, gift card, cash, voucher, check) and other appropriate details. 3. Investigators are to specify the types of payments to be offered, and provide specific information regarding each category. The CCI will consider the protocol, including the time commitment and the proposed procedures, when determining if the planned amount is appropriate. The CCI does not have a set list of recommended remuneration amounts for specific tests or length of visits, nor does it require that one method (gift cards, cash, etc.) must be used. The Committee recognizes that varying amounts and methods of remuneration may be appropriate depending on the particular circumstances of a protocol.","The IRB requires investigators to identify the amounts and types of payments offered to research subjects. Investigators are encouraged to consider what on average is reasonable. 1. Reimbursement 2. Compensation 3. Tokens of appreciation 4. Incentives: Incentives are generally discouraged in pediatric research; however, the IRB will consider whether an incentive unduly influences a child and/or family to participate when reviewing and approving this type of payment. Any bonus payment for completion of the trial must be reasonable and not so large as to induce participants to stay in the trial. In addition to approving specific amounts and types of payments, the IRB may also require changes in the amount and/or type. Any change or modification to approved amounts and/or types of payment must be submitted to the IRB as an amendment.","Any person who works near or adjacent to, any sort of machine will receive training in the hazards of the machines they work on upon hire, when their job tasks change and during topic specific departmental training sessions.

What are the specific conditions and complications that warrant a repeat hearing screen for infants according to the Joint Committee on Infant Hearing JCIH,0,"1. Massachusetts requires all newborns to receive a hearing screening by three months of age, unless the parent/guardian objects to a screen based on sincerely held religious beliefs 2. Hearing Screening must occur at the birth hospital before initial discharge to home or at a referring hospital (if the newborn is directly transferred from the birth hospital) before initially discharged to home a. BCH clinicians should obtain and document in the patient's chart information from the transferring hospital if a hearing screen was performed and the results of such screen. If the screen was not successful, missed, or the infant did not pass prior to the transfer, BCH shall conduct the screen prior to initial discharge to home. b. BCH clinicians must notify the parent(s)/guardian(s) both orally and in writing if a heaing screening was not successful, missed, or the infant did not pass. If a repeat or further screening cannot occur prior to discharge, the parent(s)/guardian(s) should be informed in writing of the inability to test prior to discharge, and the following should occur: i. Notify the infant's primary care provider; and ii. An appointment should be made at a DPH approved screening center such as BCH (note based on lack of availability of appointments at available locations, parents can also be provided with a list of sites that conduct such diagnostic screening for their choice). 3. If an infant cannot be screened due to delayed physiological development or physiological instability (related to but not limited to an illness or premature birth) as determined by the treating clinician, the infant shall be screened prior to discharge and as early as the identified physiological development or stability will permit reliable screening. 4. If the infant is discharged to home prior to conducting the hearing screen, an appointment is made for a screen to be performed within 1 month of the infants birth (note based on lack of availability of appointments at available locations, parents can also be provided with a list of sites that conduct such diagnostic screening for their choice). a. The infant's primary care provider should be notified that a hearing screen is pending. Re-screening 5. The Joint Committee on Infant Hearing (JCIH) recommends a repeat hearing screen prior to discharge for infants with conditions/complications associated with potential hearing loss. a. Conditions that warrant re-screening include, but are not limited to, history of ECMO, bilirubin level >20 and/or hyperbilirubinemia requiring an exchange transfusion, gentamicin dosing>72 hrs, furosemide>7 doses, culture-positive sepsis, and meningitis.","The MD/NP determines if the infant's hearing screen was completed at the birth hospital. If the infant has not had a hearing screening at the birth hospital or if the infant requires a repeat screen as determined by the guidelines in this policy, the medical team: • informs the parent/legal guardian of the significance of the hearing screenings. • contacts Audiology (ext 5-6461 or via Newborn Hearing Screen Request in EHR) to alert of the need for the screening prior to discharge. The Audiology Assistant performs the hearing screen. The Audiologist: • Reports normal results in patient chart (paper, if applicable, and in EHR) and communicates results to the parent/legal guardian. If the parent/legal guardian is not available, results are conveyed via telephone and/or postal mail. • Reports abnormal results to the medical team and to the parent/legal guardian, and documents results in the EHR. A member of the medical team and/or the audiologist discusses with the parent/legal guardian abnormal results, the result implications, and need for further testing. The Audiologist gives a list of DPH-approved diagnostic test centers to the parent/legal guardian and instructs him/her to make a follow-up diagnostic audiological evaluation appointment at an approved test center. If the infant does not pass the hearing test prior to discharge, the nurse documents that the follow-up appointment has been scheduled on the Newborn Hearing Screening Test Result form located in the ""consults"" section of the patient's chart. • If the follow-up appointment has not been scheduled, the nurse assists the parent/legal guardian with this process and documents the time and date of the appointment on the appropriate line of the form.","Massachusetts defines ""newborn infant"" for purposes of the hearing screen as an infant under three months of age and the term ""hearing screen"" is a test to detect hearing thresholds of 30 decibels or greater in the speech frequency range in either ear.

How should staff involved in the interventional radiology procedure document their count of all countable items in the sterile field throughout the procedure as per the hospital policy,0,"• Sharp and guidewire counts are performed for all Interventional Radiology procedures • Sponge counts are done on all Interventional Radiology procedures in which a ""surgical pocket"" is created and the possibility exists that a sponge could be retained. X-ray detectable sponges will be used in all cases that require the creation of a surgical pocket. • Staff involved in the procedure: ◦ Follow standards that are adapted from AORN practices by accounting for all countable items in their entirety. ◦ Maintain a record of counted items added to the sterile field throughout the procedure. ◦ Document in RadNet all counts including the initials of the team members who verify the counts. • Perform guidewire/sharp/sponge item counts: ◦ Before the procedure to establish a baseline. ◦ When additional counted items are added to the sterile field. ◦ At end of the procedure or when surgical pocket is sutured. ◦ At the time of permanent relief of the technologist, whenever feasible, (although direct visualization of all items may not be possible). • If any intraprocedural count is incorrect, follow the hospital's Incorrect Counts Procedure .","1. Perform counts for all procedures in which countable items are utilized. 2. View items being counted concurrently and count audibly by two individuals; RN and procedure member. 3. Full undivided attention of the team is required during all counts; avoid any distraction, interruptions, or changes in staff mid-count. 4. Counts occur at the following times: a. Before the procedure to establish a baseline (initial count) b. Prior to closure of a cavity within a cavity c. At the time wound closure begins d. At skin closure or end of the procedure 5. Record additional counted items that are added to the sterile field during the procedure. 6. Additional counts may occur upon request of any member of the surgical team. 7. Items will not be subtracted or removed from the count. 8. RN and procedure member complete a changeover count with incoming team at the time of permanent relief of either position, although direct visualization of all items may not be possible. 9. Use the pocketed sponge holder on all cases that require 4x4, 4x8, 12x12 or 18x18 sponges to account for all sponges at completion of procedure. 10. Use the RF detection system on all cases except those requiring MR scanning. 11. Withhold non-radiopaque gauze dressing materials from the field until the surgical wound is closed. Dressing material that comes in the pack are passed off to the circulating nurse. 12. Keep all counted items within the OR or procedure room until the counts are completed and reconciled. a. Do not remove linen and waste containers until all counts are completed and reconciled, and the patient has been transferred out of the room. 13. A team may waive counts in a surgical emergency. For more information on counting during an emergency click here . 14. Take a plain radiograph for incorrect needle count when the needle size is known to be 10mm or larger 15. Verbalize and document final count results. 16. The team acknowledges count outcome.","Sharp Counts 1. Two individuals, (technologist, physician or nurse) audibly count and view concurrently all sharps and suture needles. 2. The technologist continually maintains an accurate account of all sharps on the sterile field. 3. Members of the IR team account for sharps broken during a procedure in their entirety by matching pieces against an intact same sharp. 4. All counted sharps remain within IR and/or sterile field during the procedure. Do not remove linen or waste containers from IR until all counts are completed and resolved. If a counted sharp is passed off or inadvertently dropped off the sterile field, the IR technologist retrieves it in a safe manner and isolates it from the field to be included in the final count. Keep used needles on the sterile field in a disposable puncture-resistant needle container. 5. Account for and properly dispose of all sharps and miscellaneous items according to OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Standards during end of case cleanup. 6. At the time of permanent relief of the technologist, whenever feasible, (although direct visualization of all items may not be possible). Guidewire Counts Guidewire count should be performed for any procedure where the possibility exists that a guidewire could be retained in the patient. This includes but is not limited to: • Angiograms • Venograms • Sclerotherapy • Endovenous laser procedures • Gastrointestinal tubes • Nephrostomy tubes • Abscess drainages • PICC lines Performing Guidewire Count 1. Two individuals (technologist, physician or nurse) audibly count and view concurrently all used guidewires. Guidewires should be visualized to assure proper integrity and that the distal tip is still intact. This is particularly important if noticeable resistance was encountered during withdrawal of the wire. 2. The technologist continually maintains an accurate account of all guidewire on the sterile field. 3. All counted guidewires remain within IR and/or sterile field during the procedure. Do not remove linen or waste containers from IR until all counts are completed and resolved. If a counted guidewire is inadvertently dropped off the sterile field, the IR technologist retrieves and isolates it from the field to be included in the final count. 4. At the time of permanent relief of the technologist, whenever feasible, (although direct visualization of all items may not be possible). Sponge Count (only for procedures in which surgical pocket is created) 5. All sponges used during an Interventional Radiology procedure in which a ""surgical pocket"" is created, must be x-ray detectable; keep sponges in their original configuration - do not cut. Altering a sponge invalidates subsequent counts and increases the risk of a portion being retained in the pocket. 6. X-ray detectable sponges are counted audibly and viewed concurrently as they are separated and counted by two individuals (technologist, nurse, physician). ◦ Tails of sponges are clearly visible when counting and should not be cut from sponges. ◦ Break all tapes on each sponge pack; separate and count each sponge individually. 7. All counted sponges remain within the IR room/sterile field during the procedure. Do not remove linen or waste containers from the OR room until all counts are completed and resolved. 8. Maintain an ongoing tally of sponges throughout the procedure. 9. Withhold non-radiopaque gauze dressing materials from the field until the surgical pocket is closed and the final count is complete. 10. Account for and properly dispose of all sponges according to OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Standards during end-of case cleanup. 11. Countable sponges should not be cut, however if they need to be cut then all pieces are accounted for in their entirety during the final count. If item has been cut in multiple pieces, compare with an identical, intact item. Measure or trace and compare with original measurement or tracing. Incorrect Counts Procedure If a discrepancy in any count occurs follow these steps: 12. Perform an extensive search of the sterile field, surrounding area, trash and linen for the missing item. 13. When item is not accounted for, the radiologist performs an x-ray or fluoroscopic image to confirm the item is not in the patient. Documentation 14. Mark all unresolved counts as incorrect in Radnet and in the IR physician post procedural documentation stating negative radiological findings. 15. File the required SERS report per state regulations.","• Implementation • General Process • The role of the RN circulator includes: ◦ Recording counts of soft goods, sharps, miscellaneous items and items placed in the wound on the pre-printed count sheets ◦ Recording instrument counts on pre-printed instrument count sheets ◦ Observing for items dropped from the sterile field ◦ Reporting any count discrepancy and participate in reconciliation activities ◦ Documenting count activities, refer to Documentation • The role of the scrub person includes: ◦ Maintaining an organized sterile field and awareness of the location of countable goods within the sterile field ◦ Verifying the integrity and completeness of items when they are returned from the surgical site. The scrub person will immediately notify the surgical team if any discrepancy is observed. ◦ Counting surgical items in a manner that allows the RN circulator to see the items ◦ Speaking up when a discrepancy exists and participates in reconciliation activities • The role of the surgeon includes: ◦ Using radiopaque surgical items in the wound ◦ Communicating placement of surgical items (e.g., backgrounds, corneal shields, dilators, packing, stents, vascular clips) into the wound or into a body cavity, orifice, or to the perioperative team for notation in a visible location ◦ Notifying the team when items are removed ◦ Performing a methodical wound exploration before closing the wound, using both visualization and touch when feasible ◦ Communicating items left intentionally as packing ◦ Participating in count reconciliation activities ◦ Acknowledging status of final count • Counts are not performed during critical phases of a procedure (e.g., time outs, critical dissection, opening of implants, induction/emergence from anesthesia, specimen reconciliation). • Avoid altering countable items (whenever possible): ◦ Team members at the surgical field should communicate any items that have been altered (e.g., intentionally cut) ◦ During the subsequent counts, items should be accounted for in their entirety ◦ Note: If necessary, open an identical item to compare and ensure that an altered item has been retrieved in its entirety • A scrub person will visually inspect all surgical items as they are passed back from the field that may have broken or become separated within the confines of the surgical site. (e.g., sharps, instruments, wires and miscellaneous items). If a broken item is returned from the surgical site, the scurb person will immediately notify the surgical team. • Count Process: • Baseline counts occur prior to the patient entering the OR to the best extent possible. • Wound Closure ""Time Out"" • Surgeon/designee or nurse uses active communication to announce ""wound closure time out"" to acknowledge that closing the surgical wound has begun. • Surgeon/designee removes counted items and instruments from the surgical wound and field at the initiation of the closing count process when applicable. • Attending surgeon/designee performs a methodical wound exploration before closure of the surgical site. • Use the below sequence for counting sponge/sharp/miscellaneous item/instruments at closing: ◦ Begin the count at the surgical site and immediate surrounding area ◦ Proceed to the mayo stand and back table ◦ End with counted items that have been discarded from the field • Avoid interruptions and distractions during closing count. • The team acknowledges count status. • Counting Soft Goods • Break all tapes on each sponge pack • Sponges are counted audibly and viewed concurrently as they are completely separated. • Tails of sponges are clearly visible when counting. • If the package contains an incorrect number of sponges, bag, label and isolate the entire pack from the rest of the sponges in the room.(sponges may be removed from the room if this occurs during the baseline count prior to incision). • Use only un-marked sponges as dressings. • Process for pocketed sponge holder: ◦ Place one sponge per pocket ◦ Place the RF marker or tail of lap sponge facing forward so that it is readily visible in the pocketed bag system ◦ Before patient leaves the OR a visual and verbal confirmation by RN and scrub person is done to verify that all pockets are filled ◦ For more information on use of the RF sponge system see: RF Surgical Sponge Detection System • Counting Sharps and Miscellaneous Goods: • Account for sharps and other miscellaneous items that are opened onto the sterile field during all procedures in which sharps and miscellaneous item are used and could be retained. • Count all suture needles, regardless of size, for all surgical procedures. • If a sharp or miscellaneous item is passed or dropped from the sterile field, the RN circulator should retrieve it using standard precautions, show it to the scrub person, isolate it from the field, and include it in the final count.Handle sharp items with an instrument and place in a sharps/needle counting device that is separate from the sterile field. • Grids and strips (neurosurgery) are counted and documented in ""Grids and Strips or SEEG"" Surginet section when inserted and removed. ◦ Count is verified using active communication between scrub nurse, circulator, EP technologist, and surgeon prior to documenting • For a list of suggested miscellaneous item see: Miscellaneous Count Items . • Counting Instruments: • Team will conduct a baseline instrument count for: ◦ All procedures in which a body cavity is entered (i.e. Thorax, abdomen and pelvis) regardless of incision size ◦ All laparoscopic, thorascopic and robotic procedures to establish a baseline ◦ Individual pieces of assembled instruments are counted separately (e.g. suction tips, sheaths, plugs, stylets) • Instrument Count Excemtions • The team will forgo instrument count for hip and spinal surgeries; however team will ensure following requirements are met: ◦ Save a radiographic image obtained at time of wound closure to rule out retained instruments ◦ Surgeon will read radiographic image as being clear of unintentionally retained instruments and document results in the medical record • The following are closing Instrument Count Exemptions: ◦ If the final incision is less than 8cm wide and/or 8cm deep ◦ Laparoscopic or robotic procedures • Intentionally retained packed sponges/items: • For documentation add segment ""Retained Item"" and include number and type of sponges/items retained or removed. • Place retained items wristband on patient limb with ID Band. • Place extra band in patient chart for replacement should it become necessary. • Relay information of intentionally retained sponges/items to post-op caregivers. • Removing intentionally retained items • When removing retained item in OR verify with previous documentation number and type of sponges/ items previously retained. • Isolate removed sponges/ items and exclude from counts. • Remove retained items wristband when all retained items are removed. • Initiate incorrect count process if all sponges/ items to be removed are not accounted for. • Count Discrepancy/Incorrect Counts • Count Discrepancy: • Notify surgeon and surgical team of count discrepancy. • Suspend closure of the wound, if possible. • Surgeon(s) re-explores operative site for the missing item. • Re-count all previously counted items. • Notify charge nurse and request assistance, if needed. • Perform extensive search of the surgical field, surrounding area, trash and linen for the missing item. • Utilize RF detection system to detect missing sponge(s).

What are the steps for completing a Manual Chemical Inventory and when would this process be necessary,0,"The Chemical Inventory Reconciliation is performed annually, on behalf of the organization, by the Environmental Health and Safety Department. Hazardous Materials storage locations captured within the CISPro electronic chemical inventory program are located within the Enders, Karp, CLS, Fegan, Farley, Hunnewell, Bader, Pavillion, Waltham, Lexington and Peabody locations. Hazardous materials are ordered throughout the year by various areas using a specific approval code within PeopleSoft. These orders are reviewed by the Environmental Health & Safety Department to assure users have the appropriate use and storage locations, waste disposal facilities, training, and other relevant chemical safety parameters before the material is ordered by the supply chain purchase agent. Approved materials are entered into the CISPro database to enable supply chain the ability to create location/bottle specific bar codes which instantaneously updates the chemical inventory upon arrival of the material. Employees are required to remove the CISPro bar codes from chemical containers and affix them to the posted disposal sheets within the laboratory. Environmental Health & Safety provides new disposal bar code sheets within the laboratory, scans discarded bar codes, and updates the system. When a new chemical is introduced or an old chemical is removed that will change the NFPA rating for the room, the Environmental Health and Safety Department adjusts the hazard ratings and updates the NFPA 704 Diamond sign. Completing a Manual Chemical Inventory The process noted below is to be performed by hazardous material users not currently captured within the CISPro inventory program. For example, laboratories moving in after the annual reconciliation, new offsite locations, previously existing spaces now requiring hazardous materials, etc How To Determine if a Chemical is Hazardous Hazard ratings can be found on the chemical label and may appear in numerical form as in the 704 Diamond, or in image form or text form. Information to Include on the Chemical Inventory The chemical inventory should be done in an Excel spreadsheet provided by the Environmental Health and Safety Department. The spreadsheet must include: • Principal Investigator (P.I.), laboratory representative and emergency contact names and off-hours phone number (i.e. home or cell phone number) • Location of where the chemical is kept (i.e. room number, bay number, or flammable cabinet) • Chemical name • CAS # (Chemical Abstract System number) • Physical state (solid or liquid) • New quantity • Brand (i.e. Aldrich, Sigma, VWR) • Any NFPA information if known from MSDSs For Principal Investigators that have more than one laboratory location, a spreadsheet needs to be submitted for each laboratory location, for proper room hazard designation. Example Spreadsheet Set-up: Chemicals have a way of turning up in the least likely locations and therefore, to perform an accurate and complete inventory of the lab, all cabinets, shelves, corners and cubbies must be checked! Take this opportunity to discard any old, out of date or no longer used chemicals. Label these chemicals with a Hazardous Waste label, place them in the Satellite Accumulation Areas and submit a Hazardous Waste Pick-up Request Form . Note: If you discover a chemical that does not look as it should or a container that does not appear to be intact, DO NOT MOVE THE CHEMICAL. Call ext 5-3499; briefly describe the situation, and ask to have the Safety-on-Call person paged. Submitting the Chemical Inventory Spreadsheet Forward the completed Chemical Inventory spreadsheet as an email attachment to the Environmental Health and Safety Department. What will the Chemical Inventories be used for? Environmental Health and Safety will use these inventories to identify the hazard level of each laboratory in the Enders Facility and will update the 704 Diamond sign located on every entrance door to a lab. Copies of the completed inventories will be placed with security for easy access in an emergency. Additionally, any ""4"" ratings will be highlighted for quick reference in an emergency situation. There may be some instances where the label does not identify the contents as hazardous. In this case, refer to the Material Safety Data Sheet for the specific chemical information. MSDS's are available online from the Children's Hospital internal home page; click the "" Material Safety Data Sheets "" link.","All laboratories, procedure rooms, and chemical storage areas must complete an annual inventory of hazardous chemicals and compressed gases. Note: Hazardous materials are any liquid or solid chemical that has a hazard rating assigned to it, as well as compressed gasses and liquid nitrogen. On an annual basis, the Environmental Health & Safety Department coordinates the chemical inventory reconciliation process on all hazardous materials used and/or stored in the lab to: • ensure the safety of all occupants of the facility by providing information and/or hazard warnings to employees entering or working in a laboratory, • provide an appropriate alert for the protection of public and private emergency response personnel, and • assist in planning for effective fire and emergency control operations. All areas that store and use hazardous chemicals and compressed gases are required by the Environmental Health and Safety Department to keep an updated chemical inventory or obtain a copy from the Chemical Inventory web page.","1. Several months prior to the end of the fiscal year, the Hospital shall contract with a Pharmacy Inventory Company to perform the annual inventory. This service agreement must be received, approved and signed by a BCH VP prior to the established date of the inventory. 2. The pharmacy buyer reconciles Borrow/loan accounts with other hospitals early in August. 3. Pharmacy will provide a pricing file to the Pharmacy Inventory Company listing products purchased from the Primary and Secondary Prime Vendors during the past fiscal year by name, NDC and cost per package size. Pharmacy will also provide a list of direct purchase items using the same format. For those few instances where the Pharmacy Inventory company inventories a product not previously provided to them by the Pharmacy, the Pharmacy will look up the information and provide it to the Pharmacy Inventory Company prior to their completion of the inventory. 4. When drugs are purchased at both 340B (PHS) and GPO/WAC pricing, then the Director of Business Operations, Pharmacy, or designee, will provide a weighted average cost based on total purchase cost to be used for pricing those drugs. 5. Internal preparations include reviewing all storage areas in order to identify and separate expired drugs. 6. Prior to the day of inventory, a notification to staff will be issued via email to alert them to the possible presence of workers from the Pharmacy Inventory Company in their work spaces. 7. Prior to the day of inventory, a teleconference(s) will be held between Pharmacy staff, Pharmacy Inventory Company management and representative(s) from CHB finance to review procedures, areas and locations to be inventoried, the timing of the inventory and to familiarize all with procedures to be followed on inventory day. 8. On the day of inventory, signs are posted to clearly designate which items are to be counted. 9. Pharmacy Inventory Company staff will be given a quick briefing on the day of the inventory and will be escorted to their respective inventory location. The Inventory Company staff shall never be left unattended. The Inventory Company will designate a team coordinator who will assign areas for his/her staff. 10. During the inventory process Pharmacy staff or other non-Pharmacy Inventory company staff take sample counts, recording and initialing their findings which will be compared to the findings of the Inventory Company. 11. During the inventory process, a representative from BCH finance will visit and ask questions, in order to confirm that the inventory is being conducted within necessary parameters, from the financial perspective. 12. When the count is completed, the spreadsheet and other document provided by the inventory company are reviewed for quality and completeness and corrections are made prior to final approval. Any changes need to be made by the inventory company prior to acceptance of the inventory. 13. The results of the approved inventory a submitted to the Hospital Auditor as well as maintained by the Director of Business Operations, Pharmacy. 14. Based on the difference between the theoretical inventory (General Ledger balance) and the physical inventory valuation, a General Ledger adjustment may be made and approved Senior VP of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.","The following questions and answers are intended to help researchers and the IRB determine when immediate safety plans are required. 1. What type of questionnaires or assessments would require an immediate safety action plan? An immediate safety plan is required for questionnaires or assessments that either: a. Include individual items that indicate that someone is at real potential risk for harm – this would include single items that ask about suicidality, or child abuse, or plans to commit a violent act, etc. or b. Use tools that validly correspond to specific psychological conditions and have established ""clinically- actionable"" values or scores that suggest a potential diagnosis (e.g., Beck Depression Inventory) Participants who score in the clinical range on validated assessments or provide a concerning answer on individual items should trigger the safety action plan. 2. Do quality of life assessments or questionnaires that may ask about sadness, feeling anxiousness, or levels of stress require a safety action plan? These assessments are not typically developed to identify potential mental/psychological illnesses or actionable conditions such as depression and mood disorders. These scales do not require an immediate safety plan. a. However, when possible, investigators should consider ways of maximizing the potential for benefit for subjects who agree to participate in research. b. Depending on the type of information learned and the relationship with the subject, there may be ways to utilize the information from these questionnaires for the benefit of the subject. i. For example, responses may suggest that it may be helpful to offer a subject a referral to a social worker or provide additional resource information. c. Investigators also need to consider whether it may be beneficial to include results of validated assessments in the medical record so that other care providers may have access to the information and the ability to use the information for comparisons over time or if thought to be clinically relevant for planning care. i. These plans should be described in the potential benefit section of the research protocol and included in the informed consent document or process. 3. What should an immediate safety plan include? The following components must be included in a safety plan and specified in the protocol submitted to the IRB. In general, safety plans should align with standard clinical practice. If a safety plan deviates from standard practice, a rationale for the deviation should be provided. The IRB also expects that, when necessary, those who develop safety plans seek guidance from individuals experienced with standard clinical practice. This will help assure the plan meets the standards required. Items to note: a. The assessments should be reviewed immediately when a subject is present or within 24 hours if the information is collected remotely. b. The individual performing/collecting and reviewing the assessments must be qualified to interpret the results or have plans to consult with qualified individuals within a specified time frame. Protocols should include these plans based on the acuity of the response. c. Plans need to include immediate referral to appropriate mental health personnel and services for further assessment and management d. Plans must also include appropriate notification of the concern to the subject and parents/legal guardians (if applicable). e. Plans should include notification of relevant agencies (i.e., Dept. of Children and Families) or use of law enforcement personnel (e.g., police, security, etc.) to detain the individual for assessment and necessary services (if applicable). f. The consent form should include information so that subjects/recognize the potential need to breach confidentiality and obtain necessary services. Recommended steps, methods and guidance on how covered persons are to perform process, recognizing every case and patient are different.","Boston Children's Hospital's Institutional Review Board (IRB) policy and federal regulations state that informed consent must be obtained prior to obtaining any study information, and that the entire consent process should be accurately documented. When the IRB requires a written consent form, the discussion or process may take place by a means other than a face-to-face/in person communication. For example, an investigator may discuss the study over the phone or a use another HIPPA compliant method of video conferencing method. However, both methods still require the parent to sign a written consent document. When this occurs, additional steps are necessary to accurately document the consent process, especially if the consent cannot be immediately returned to the investigator. This guidance is to ensure adequate documentation of prospective informed consent for research when a parent/legal guardian is not present. It is not intended to describe the process for obtaining an e-signature (electronic signature) that is expected to meet all criteria to be legally recognized in accordance with regulatory requirements (i.e. e-consent for U.S. Food & Drug Administration regulated research). • Federal regulatory agencies do not regard verbal telephone consent as constituting the documentation of signed informed consent that is required by the federal regulations. • There are times when the IRB can approve a method other than written consent that allows a subject the ability to check a box electronically to provide consent. The guidelines provided should not be confused with the IRB finding that a protocol meets the criteria for a waiver or alteration of consent.",4,2,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

How is a postoperative surgical site infection SSI diagnosed according to the hospitals policy,1,Diagnosis of a postoperative surgical site infection (SSI) will be made as defined in the modification of the CDC definitions of surgical wound infections.,"Deep incisional SSI must meet the following criteria: The infection occurs within one year (implant in place) and the infection appears related to the operative procedure and the infection involves the deep soft tissues (i.e., fascial and muscle layers) of the incision. In addition it must meet at least one of the following: purulent drainage from the deep incision but not from the organ/space of the surgical site; a deep incision that spontaneously dehisces or is deliberately opened by a surgeon when the patient has at least one of the following signs or symptoms (fever greater than 38 degrees Centigrade, localized pain, or tenderness, unless the incision is culture negative); an abscess or other evidence of infection involving the deep incision is found on direct examination, during reoperation, or by histopathologic or radiologic examination; or diagnosis of a deep incisional SSI by a surgeon or attending surgeon.","1.

Preoperative antibiotics Appropriate antibiotics to cover common organisms are needed. One study has suggested that use of clindamycin increases risk of infection. There are several studies as discussed above that have demonstrated a high rate of gram negative infections, and therefore coverage for these organisms makes sense. In addition, appropriate timing of antibiotic dosing is critical, as inappropriate dosing as defined as antibiotics given greater than 60 minutes prior to incision represent a risk of infection. The current recommendations of the AAOS are to use appropriate antibiotics for 24 hours postoperatively. One study failed to demonstrate a benefit of continuing antibiotics beyond 24 hours when a drain is in place. References 24.

This policy establishes what parameters must be observed and the care that must be employed in both the immediate and long-term postoperative recovery periods. 1. Immediate Postoperative Recovery a. The immediate postoperative recovery period is defined as the period of time following the completion of surgical procedure until the animal is sternal. The following measures must be taken to provide a smooth and safe recovery from anesthesia: i. Animals must be monitored every 15 minutes until they are sternal and documentation must be recorded in the postoperative record. ii. To prevent hypothermia animals can be wrapped in blankets or drapes or placed on a circulating warm water pad. iii. The endotracheal tube must not be removed until the animal displays an adequate gag reflex and begins to chew. An approved member of the protocol must remain with the animal until it is extubated. Leaving the endotracheal tube in place prevents aspiration pneumonia if the animal should vomit and also maintains a patent airway with easy access if complications should arise. iv. Animals must be turned from side to side every 30 minutes until they are able to remain sternal. Turning the animal helps prevent pulmonary congestion v. The animals' vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature) must be recorded every 30 minutes until the animal is sternal. vi. After the animal is extubated and in sternal recumbency, assess the amount of pain and discomfort they are exhibiting and treat appropriately. Refer to the parameters used for pain assessment and analgesics outlined in the policy for Pain and Distress and the Animal Research Investigator's Manual. vii. Conduct any blood work that may seem appropriate at this time. For example, if the animal lost a large amount of blood during the procedure, a hematocrit may need to be obtained. 2. Long Term Post-Operative Recovery a. The long term postoperative recovery period, which requires at least daily monitoring, is considered a minimum of 7 days post-surgery for major procedures, and 3 days post-surgery for minor procedures. The investigator or a protocol approved member of the surgical team must evaluate the animal at least once daily for 7 days post surgery and record the animal's condition in the postoperative care form. In addition to this, all large animals will also be monitored daily by the ARCH veterinary staff to provide additional care if needed. Large animals will be singly housed and exempted from social housing following surgical procedures. They will be singly housed for a minimum of 3 days post-surgery and for the duration of any treatments or recovery. All large animals will be released from the social housing exemption only upon veterinary discretion. The following are a list of parameters to monitor and document in the postoperative care form: i. Note any reduction in activity level or appetite. ii. Pain assessment based on parameters outlines in the policy for pain and distress. iii. Examination of the incision/surgical site. iv. Respiratory rate and effort. v. Heart rate and character. vi. Hydration using skin turgor and if eyes are sunken as a means of evaluation. vii. Temperatures of clinically abnormal animals are monitored daily until clinical improvement is noted. Because monitoring of temperature can be very stressful for some animals, animals that are in good health and are recovering normally may not have temperatures recorded during the post-operative period.",This policy intends to provide a framework to guide the care and planning for the admission and postoperative course for the bariatric and metabolic surgery patients at Boston Children's Hospital. All patients entering the Adolescent Bariatric Surgery Program: 1. Are screened based on the defined selection criteria approved by the Adolescent Bariatric Surgery (ABS) Multidisciplinary Committee in accordance with the standards set by the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP). 2. Attend the Adolescent Bariatric Surgery Information Session presented by the surgeon. 3. Have a psychosocial-behavioral evaluation prior to surgery. 4. Have all necessary testing and receive appropriate consultations recommended by the Adolescent Bariatric Surgical Team prior to surgery. The consultations and testing are based upon the approved ABS screening algorithm . 5. Receive preoperative and postoperative nutritional education. 6. Have demonstrated compliance with all surgical readiness standards set by the team and have the unanimous approval of the Adolescent Bariatric Surgery Surgical Team before surgery is scheduled. 7. Have appropriate equipment available. See the Bariatric Product Reference Tool for more information. 8. Receive anticipatory postoperative education. 9. Have close follow up with the surgical team post operatively and agree to be followed for life by a bariatric surgery center.,4,4,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
What procedure should be followed for the original films in the hospitals highprofile legal films policy,0,"1. In the case of suspected Child Abuse, the radiologist will notify the film library or the supervisor of the film library that there are films that have been identified as suspected child abuse. 2. The film librarian (or the Manager, Support Services) will flag the master jacket with an iridescent sticker that states, original films are not to be released except internally in radiology, the emergency room or on site hospital clinic. For all other requests, only copies can be signed out. 3. If the radiologist indicates that the films are of a high profile nature, then they should be removed to the Manager, Support Services' office and signed out to ""MACDL""","Films are not loaned outside the hospital. Copies should be made and the originals maintained in the master jacket. Any exceptions should be handled by the Supervisor or Day Lead Image Service Representative, who will obtain signed authorization from the parent/legal guardian accepting responsibility for their loaned films. Delinquent Film Policy (Outpatient) Sixty days is the limit for x-rays to be signed out to any doctor. Attorney and Insurance Company Film Requests Any loan requested by an insurance company or lawyer's office must have a signed release by a patient or legal guardian/parent. We do not send original films to them. If they request copies, they may be billed (refer to FGE-COP). One week should be allowed for x-rays to be mailed anywhere in Massachusetts. The x-rays are not the property of the patient. They belong to the hospital. The hospital is legally responsible for them. X-rays should not be released for an attorney's subpoena unless it comes with a signed release form from the patient. Copies are made. Originals are not sent.","1. Films that have been identified as high profile/legal should be removed to the Manager, Support Services' office and signed out in Quadris as ""MACDL"" 2. If the films in this file are needed for patient care, then they can be removed and a note with the name, telephone number, beeper of the physician and the location that the films have been taken to should be left for the Manager, Support Services so that he can follow up on them. Direct any other questions about these films, to the Manager, Support Services and the Technical Director. In cases of suspected child abuse, please see Dr. Kleinman.","Outside Images that are not requested to become part of the patient's medical record When outside images are returned to the Radiology Image Service Center, they are to be mailed back to the appropriate hospital. If outside images are received by the Image Service Area, the proper destination for these films should be determined and brought or sent there. If the images are to be delivered to another location within the hospital, the location should be noted on the envelope and sent through interoffice mail. If the film is simply addressed ""Children's Hospital,"" a check will be made to see if the patient is an inpatient, in which case the films will be put in the inpatient file. If the images are to go to a radiologist, the film should be left for the supervisor to follow up the following day. Most other outside images are to be returned immediately to the proper hospital. The only exception to this is when incoming images are unaddressed. In this case, the images are placed in appropriate slot in the back area of the Image Service Center and kept for one month. On all envelopes, either write ""Return"" or attach a note on each envelope and place on shelf in the back of the Image Service Center. • A record is kept of every outside film returned. This log is separated into two categories: ◦ Massachusetts - alphabetically by cities ◦ Out of State - alphabetically by state, then subdivided alphabetically by cities of that state. With each film: ◦ Record name of patient ◦ Name and address of where films are being sent ◦ Date of mailing NOTE: The outside film log is kept on the shelf near the rear door of the Image Service Area. It is used to check addresses if they are not clear. There is often one page devoted entirely to a particular hospital. In these cases, nothing is entered under the city in general. If another hospital requests the return of their x-rays, the following are checked: ◦ Outside films to be returned ◦ Slot containing unaddressed outside films ◦ Log to see if they, in fact, have been returned ◦ Patient's CH film folder (if one exists) ◦ Check patient's reports (if they exist) as to the service of the patient, and contact the doctors or clinics to see if the films are there. If the images still cannot be found, fill in a form letter stating that the Radiology Department does not have the images, and any further information relating to the service of the patient would be helpful for a further search. Mailing Envelopes Over sized mailing envelopes for films can be ordered free of charge for ISC use by calling Postal Service (Rosemary) at 617-654-5298. Outside Image Copies (Films or CDs) If outside images are loaded into Synapse and/or they are no longer needed, they should be kept for 1 month and then destroyed. Copy Images that are not loaded into Synapse will only be kept in Children's Master Jacket if specifically requested by Clinician.","• There are circumstances under which films must be kept in a more secure location. Some of the films that fall into this category are: films of suspected child abuse, legal cases and high profile cases. • In general, we do not ""loan"" films to outside locations, but will make copies.",1,1,4,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
When should needleless connectors be changed and what are the specific exceptions to the 96hour guideline,1,"1. Change needleless connectors every 96 hours or when clinically indicated: a. When infusing lipid based material or blood/blood products, change needleless connectors every 24 hours. Examples include: Ambisome, Fat Emulsion, Omegaven, Propofol. b. Coordinate needleless connector changes with line changes to limit unnecessary access. 2. Change needleless connectors using aseptic, no-touch technique. 3. Everyone within 6 ft wears a mask. a. Note: Individuals in the other bedspace of a double room with closed curtain do not need a mask.","1. Needleless connectors do not need to be changed after blood sampling unless there is residual blood within the needleless connector. 2. Needleless connectors are changed prior to obtaining a blood or fungal culture . See Blood Culture Policy for details. 3. Scan labs at the point of care or perform a visual double check with a second person (e.g. clinician, parent/guardian, a child that can read and identify him/herself, clinical assistant, administrative associate, child life specialist, etc.). 4. When drawing from a double lumen CVC use the larger lumen when possible: a. Pause all infusions and clamp other lumen(s). b. Careful consideration is advised when evaluating the need to draw labs from a PICC. 5. In the ICUs, consider the use of a closed blood sampling device (e.g., VAMP Jr.™) for patients who require frequent labs as a blood conservation strategy. Additional considerations should include: a. ≥2.6 Fr required if a PICC line is used. b. Use with caution in mobile patients due to the additional weight of the device. c. Preferred dedicated line with a carrier fluid however if access is limited may infuse other fluids except vasoactive infusions. d. Non-ICU use requires a patient-specific decision by the medical team. 6. Return of blood discard (during blood draws) is only done using a closed blood sampling device.","• Use of Vacutainer® when drawing blood is currently not recommended for Blood cultures.

What types of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures are performed in the Gastroenterology Procedure Unit,0,"The primary mission of the Gastroenterology Procedure Unit (GPU) is to provide care for pediatric patients undergoing a variety of gastrointestinal procedures. These diagnostic and therapeutic procedures are essential for modern subspecialty care of patients with gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, pancreatic, and nutritional disorders. The GPU is also the procedural home to both the Motility and Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders Center and Aerodigestive Center providing a full array of diagnostic testing protocols for each subspecialty. In this state of the art center anesthesiologist-administered sedation and anesthesia are provided to children of all ages and young adults. The GPU also serves as a site for patient-oriented clinical research and quality improvement initiatives, and a resource center for patient, family, and staff education. The program continually strives to improve the quality of patient care and access to services and to increase awareness and education in the subspecialty areas of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition. This is accomplished through peer review and quality improvement initiates, by maintaining state-of-the-art equipment, by providing family education, and by formal presentations by members of the nursing and physician staff at local, national, and international conferences. The GPU provides expert care for children undergoing gastrointestinal procedures. Both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures are performed with general anesthesia. Outpatient procedures and testing are performed in the GPU, Day Surgery operating rooms, the Radiology Department, and the Nutritional Assessment Lab. Inpatient procedures may be performed in the GPU, ICU, and Radiology Department or in the Main Operating Room Suite. The majority of the patients are seen in outpatient encounters. Presently, the GPU supports endoscopic and gastrointestinal procedures and for the Sedation Service who provide procedural sedation to inpatients and outpatients who require placement of PICC lines, lumbar puncture, bone marrow biopsy, skin biopsy, joint aspiration, or other minor procedures.","The primary mission of the Gastroenterology Procedure Unit (GPU) is to provide care for patients undergoing a variety of gastrointestinal and medical procedures.

The GPU is also the procedural home to both the Motility and Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders Center and Aerodigestive Center providing a full array of diagnostic testing protocols for each subspecialty. The testing and treatments provided by the GPU can be both invasive (e.g. colonoscopy and biopsy) and noninvasive (e.g. Esophageal impedance studies, lactose breath testing) To accomplish this mission, the GPU serves as a physical site of care as well as a resource center for the provision of off-site services. The GPU works in partnership with the department of Anesthesia to offer anesthesiologist-administered sedation along with post-sedation or anesthesia recovery for children and young adults. The GPU also serves as a site for patient-oriented clinical research and quality improvement initiatives, and a resource center for patient, family, and staff education. In addition to its primary mission, the GPU also provides space and staff support for the Sedation Service.

Use of the on call support is at the discretion of the physician and GPU team.,"Ratios of procedural patient care are based on the Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates (SGNA) Minimum Registered Nurse Staffing for Patient Care in the Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Unit (SGNA, 2012). The GPU staffing plan provides technical support for GI procedures using Endoscopy Technicians. Post Anesthesia Care nursing ratios are based in the American Society of Peri Anesthesia Nurses (ASPAN) Position Statement on Minimum Staffing in Phase I PACU and Patient Classification/Recommended Staffing Guidelines (ASPAN, 2007) Staffing plans are developed based on the American Nurses Association principles of Nurse Staffing. The principles address patient care unit related, staff related and institution/organization related activities. Patient care related activities should reflect the needs of the patients, a staffing plan must consider the number of patients and the level of care required while incorporating physical and psychosocial limitations. For staff related activities, the principle needs of the patient populations should determine the competencies required of the nurse practicing. Staff skill mix and competencies, as well as leadership and organizational support guide this process. The hospital has policies to support the needs of patients and nursing staff. Thus, these policies recognize the myriad needs for both patients and nursing staff (ANA, 1999).","The Department of Otolaryngology and Communication Enhancement provides evaluative, diagnostic and therapeutic care for infants, children, adolescents and young adults with disorders of the head and neck.

What are the steps to be taken in case of a discrepancy in any count during an interventional radiology procedure,1,"Sharp Counts 1. Two individuals, (technologist, physician or nurse) audibly count and view concurrently all sharps and suture needles. 2. The technologist continually maintains an accurate account of all sharps on the sterile field. 3. Members of the IR team account for sharps broken during a procedure in their entirety by matching pieces against an intact same sharp. 4. All counted sharps remain within IR and/or sterile field during the procedure. Do not remove linen or waste containers from IR until all counts are completed and resolved. If a counted sharp is passed off or inadvertently dropped off the sterile field, the IR technologist retrieves it in a safe manner and isolates it from the field to be included in the final count. Keep used needles on the sterile field in a disposable puncture-resistant needle container. 5. Account for and properly dispose of all sharps and miscellaneous items according to OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Standards during end of case cleanup. 6. At the time of permanent relief of the technologist, whenever feasible, (although direct visualization of all items may not be possible). Guidewire Counts Guidewire count should be performed for any procedure where the possibility exists that a guidewire could be retained in the patient. This includes but is not limited to: • Angiograms • Venograms • Sclerotherapy • Endovenous laser procedures • Gastrointestinal tubes • Nephrostomy tubes • Abscess drainages • PICC lines Performing Guidewire Count 1. Two individuals (technologist, physician or nurse) audibly count and view concurrently all used guidewires. Guidewires should be visualized to assure proper integrity and that the distal tip is still intact. This is particularly important if noticeable resistance was encountered during withdrawal of the wire. 2. The technologist continually maintains an accurate account of all guidewire on the sterile field. 3. All counted guidewires remain within IR and/or sterile field during the procedure. Do not remove linen or waste containers from IR until all counts are completed and resolved. If a counted guidewire is inadvertently dropped off the sterile field, the IR technologist retrieves and isolates it from the field to be included in the final count. 4. At the time of permanent relief of the technologist, whenever feasible, (although direct visualization of all items may not be possible). Sponge Count (only for procedures in which surgical pocket is created) 5. All sponges used during an Interventional Radiology procedure in which a ""surgical pocket"" is created, must be x-ray detectable; keep sponges in their original configuration - do not cut. Altering a sponge invalidates subsequent counts and increases the risk of a portion being retained in the pocket. 6. X-ray detectable sponges are counted audibly and viewed concurrently as they are separated and counted by two individuals (technologist, nurse, physician). ◦ Tails of sponges are clearly visible when counting and should not be cut from sponges. ◦ Break all tapes on each sponge pack; separate and count each sponge individually. 7. All counted sponges remain within the IR room/sterile field during the procedure. Do not remove linen or waste containers from the OR room until all counts are completed and resolved. 8. Maintain an ongoing tally of sponges throughout the procedure. 9. Withhold non-radiopaque gauze dressing materials from the field until the surgical pocket is closed and the final count is complete. 10. Account for and properly dispose of all sponges according to OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Standards during end-of case cleanup. 11. Countable sponges should not be cut, however if they need to be cut then all pieces are accounted for in their entirety during the final count. If item has been cut in multiple pieces, compare with an identical, intact item. Measure or trace and compare with original measurement or tracing. Incorrect Counts Procedure If a discrepancy in any count occurs follow these steps: 12. Perform an extensive search of the sterile field, surrounding area, trash and linen for the missing item. 13. When item is not accounted for, the radiologist performs an x-ray or fluoroscopic image to confirm the item is not in the patient. Documentation 14. Mark all unresolved counts as incorrect in Radnet and in the IR physician post procedural documentation stating negative radiological findings. 15. File the required SERS report per state regulations.","• Implementation • General Process • The role of the RN circulator includes: ◦ Recording counts of soft goods, sharps, miscellaneous items and items placed in the wound on the pre-printed count sheets ◦ Recording instrument counts on pre-printed instrument count sheets ◦ Observing for items dropped from the sterile field ◦ Reporting any count discrepancy and participate in reconciliation activities ◦ Documenting count activities, refer to Documentation • The role of the scrub person includes: ◦ Maintaining an organized sterile field and awareness of the location of countable goods within the sterile field ◦ Verifying the integrity and completeness of items when they are returned from the surgical site. The scrub person will immediately notify the surgical team if any discrepancy is observed. ◦ Counting surgical items in a manner that allows the RN circulator to see the items ◦ Speaking up when a discrepancy exists and participates in reconciliation activities • The role of the surgeon includes: ◦ Using radiopaque surgical items in the wound ◦ Communicating placement of surgical items (e.g., backgrounds, corneal shields, dilators, packing, stents, vascular clips) into the wound or into a body cavity, orifice, or to the perioperative team for notation in a visible location ◦ Notifying the team when items are removed ◦ Performing a methodical wound exploration before closing the wound, using both visualization and touch when feasible ◦ Communicating items left intentionally as packing ◦ Participating in count reconciliation activities ◦ Acknowledging status of final count • Counts are not performed during critical phases of a procedure (e.g., time outs, critical dissection, opening of implants, induction/emergence from anesthesia, specimen reconciliation). • Avoid altering countable items (whenever possible): ◦ Team members at the surgical field should communicate any items that have been altered (e.g., intentionally cut) ◦ During the subsequent counts, items should be accounted for in their entirety ◦ Note: If necessary, open an identical item to compare and ensure that an altered item has been retrieved in its entirety • A scrub person will visually inspect all surgical items as they are passed back from the field that may have broken or become separated within the confines of the surgical site. (e.g., sharps, instruments, wires and miscellaneous items). If a broken item is returned from the surgical site, the scurb person will immediately notify the surgical team. • Count Process: • Baseline counts occur prior to the patient entering the OR to the best extent possible. • Wound Closure ""Time Out"" • Surgeon/designee or nurse uses active communication to announce ""wound closure time out"" to acknowledge that closing the surgical wound has begun. • Surgeon/designee removes counted items and instruments from the surgical wound and field at the initiation of the closing count process when applicable. • Attending surgeon/designee performs a methodical wound exploration before closure of the surgical site. • Use the below sequence for counting sponge/sharp/miscellaneous item/instruments at closing: ◦ Begin the count at the surgical site and immediate surrounding area ◦ Proceed to the mayo stand and back table ◦ End with counted items that have been discarded from the field • Avoid interruptions and distractions during closing count. • The team acknowledges count status. • Counting Soft Goods • Break all tapes on each sponge pack • Sponges are counted audibly and viewed concurrently as they are completely separated. • Tails of sponges are clearly visible when counting. • If the package contains an incorrect number of sponges, bag, label and isolate the entire pack from the rest of the sponges in the room.(sponges may be removed from the room if this occurs during the baseline count prior to incision). • Use only un-marked sponges as dressings. • Process for pocketed sponge holder: ◦ Place one sponge per pocket ◦ Place the RF marker or tail of lap sponge facing forward so that it is readily visible in the pocketed bag system ◦ Before patient leaves the OR a visual and verbal confirmation by RN and scrub person is done to verify that all pockets are filled ◦ For more information on use of the RF sponge system see: RF Surgical Sponge Detection System • Counting Sharps and Miscellaneous Goods: • Account for sharps and other miscellaneous items that are opened onto the sterile field during all procedures in which sharps and miscellaneous item are used and could be retained. • Count all suture needles, regardless of size, for all surgical procedures. • If a sharp or miscellaneous item is passed or dropped from the sterile field, the RN circulator should retrieve it using standard precautions, show it to the scrub person, isolate it from the field, and include it in the final count.Handle sharp items with an instrument and place in a sharps/needle counting device that is separate from the sterile field. • Grids and strips (neurosurgery) are counted and documented in ""Grids and Strips or SEEG"" Surginet section when inserted and removed. ◦ Count is verified using active communication between scrub nurse, circulator, EP technologist, and surgeon prior to documenting • For a list of suggested miscellaneous item see: Miscellaneous Count Items . • Counting Instruments: • Team will conduct a baseline instrument count for: ◦ All procedures in which a body cavity is entered (i.e. Thorax, abdomen and pelvis) regardless of incision size ◦ All laparoscopic, thorascopic and robotic procedures to establish a baseline ◦ Individual pieces of assembled instruments are counted separately (e.g. suction tips, sheaths, plugs, stylets) • Instrument Count Excemtions • The team will forgo instrument count for hip and spinal surgeries; however team will ensure following requirements are met: ◦ Save a radiographic image obtained at time of wound closure to rule out retained instruments ◦ Surgeon will read radiographic image as being clear of unintentionally retained instruments and document results in the medical record • The following are closing Instrument Count Exemptions: ◦ If the final incision is less than 8cm wide and/or 8cm deep ◦ Laparoscopic or robotic procedures • Intentionally retained packed sponges/items: • For documentation add segment ""Retained Item"" and include number and type of sponges/items retained or removed. • Place retained items wristband on patient limb with ID Band. • Place extra band in patient chart for replacement should it become necessary. • Relay information of intentionally retained sponges/items to post-op caregivers. • Removing intentionally retained items • When removing retained item in OR verify with previous documentation number and type of sponges/ items previously retained. • Isolate removed sponges/ items and exclude from counts. • Remove retained items wristband when all retained items are removed. • Initiate incorrect count process if all sponges/ items to be removed are not accounted for. • Count Discrepancy/Incorrect Counts • Count Discrepancy: • Notify surgeon and surgical team of count discrepancy. • Suspend closure of the wound, if possible. • Surgeon(s) re-explores operative site for the missing item. • Re-count all previously counted items. • Notify charge nurse and request assistance, if needed. • Perform extensive search of the surgical field, surrounding area, trash and linen for the missing item. • Utilize RF detection system to detect missing sponge(s).

The catheter may be inserted into a peripheral vein and then the tip is threaded into a central location, called Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC). Or the CVC may be inserted percutaneously into a more central vein with a shorter distance for the tip to travel to a central location. Examples of long-term CVCs include a port, where the access point remains under the skin, or a Broviac ® or Hickman ® catheter where the access point sits outside the skin; these are generally placed in the operating room (OR) or in interventional radiology (IR). An example of a short-term CVC is a percutaneously placed central venous line (CVL) which may be placed in the ICU, IR, OR, Emergency Department (ED), or in the cardiac catheterization lab (Cath Lab).",1,1,1,4,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0

However, techniques are available that make pain reduction to an acceptable level a realistic goal in the majority of circumstances. Whenever possible behavioral and non- pharmacological interventions should be used in addition to analgesics to optimize pain management. These include: • Consoling • Heat and cold • Repositioning • Massage • Relaxation • Exercise and/or immobilization • Distraction • Preparatory information • Music, art and play therapy • Calming environment • The supportive presence of a parent or other family member Effective pain relief requires flexibility in dosing, the ability to deliver the dose to the patient ""on demand"", regular monitoring of the adequacy of analgesics and of any drug related side effects and the use of these parameters to individualize. PCA and NCA are two ways to facilitate this process. The purpose of a loading dose of opioid prior to PCA initiation is to raise the plasma concentration of opioid to the therapeutic level needed before the smaller PCA doses can provide analgesia.","1.

Warm water is the preferred agent for managing enteral tube obstructions. Using a gentle back and forth or pulsing motion with the syringe, push warm water through the tube to break up the obstruction. Carbonated beverages (i.e. cola) or cranberry juice are seldom effective and should not be used. These substances leave a residue on the lining of the enteral tube and pose additional clogging risk. If water fails to clear the obstruction, an enzyme solution should be used. The enzyme solution requires a provider order . It is called ""Gastrostomy Tube Obstruction Plan"". To clear a clogged or blocked enteral feeding tube using an enzyme solution, follow these steps: 1. Crush 1 sodium bicarbonate tablet (325 mg). Mix the powder with the contents of one enzyme capsule (Zenpep 5,000 units) in 10 mL warm water. Mix into a slurry. Allow solution to dissolve completely. 2. Instill the slurry into the obstructed feeding tube using a 10-30mL syringe. Allow 60-minute dwell time to ensure the enzyme solution has maximal contact with the obstruction. 3. Using a syringe, pull back to withdraw the slurry solution from the feeding tube (slurry as well as the obstruction). Avoid using excess force to prevent enteral tube damage. 4. Flush the enteral feeding tube with warm water prior to resuming use. Note: If you are unable to instill warm water or slurry solution due to complete obstruction of enteral feeding tube then follow protocol for replacing the tube.",4,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

What are the patient populations that may benefit from closed suctioning without manual ventilation,0,"Closed Suctioning (Routine Practice) • Closed suctioning is the use of an in-line catheter while maintaining the connection to the ventilator circuit (e.g., no manual ventilation). • Patients may benefit from closed suctioning because the loss of lung volume associated with ventilator circuit disconnection and the adverse effects of manual ventilation are minimized. • Patients who may benefit from closed suctioning without manual ventilation include: ◦ Pre-term infants and newborns ◦ Patients requiring HFOV or HFJV ◦ Patients with air leak syndromes ◦ Patients at risk for de-recruitment ◦ Patients requiring frequent suctioning (e.g., pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary edema) ◦ Patients dependent on inhaled agents (e.g., isoflurane) Closed Suctioning with Manual Ventilation (Modified Practice) • Modified closed suctioning is the use of an in-line catheter with disconnection from the ventilator circuit and the use of manual ventilation. • Patients who may benefit from modified closed suctioning with manual ventilation include: ◦ Patients who are receiving a neuromuscular blockade who have no cough ◦ Patients who have an ineffective cough ◦ Patients with a history of mucous plugging or bloody secretions",• Patients requiring mechanical ventilation are assessed by a registered nurse (RN) and a respiratory therapist at the beginning of each shift. A suction plan is made based on the patient's condition; including the decision to perform open or closed suctioning and the importance and procedure for pre-oxygenation. See Suctioning an Artificial Airway: Use of an In-line Suction Catheter with an Endotracheal Tube or Tracheostomy Tube in the ICU. • Use the High Risk Suctioning Procedure for ICU patients with following diagnosis or clinical needs: ◦ Air leak syndrome ◦ Congenital diaphragmatic hernia ◦ HFOV/HFJV ◦ Critical airway ◦ Pulmonary hypertension ◦ Inhaled anesthetic or heliox therapy ◦ iNO ◦ Shunted single ventricle patient ◦ Low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) ◦ < 1 year of age for the first 24 hours following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) ◦ PEEP dependent patients that have ◦ Known or risk for left atrial (LA) demonstrated desaturation upon hypertension as identified by CICU disconnection from the ventilator or have a attending and/or attending surgeon prolonged recovery time,"• To safely administer isoflurane, there cannot be a leak around artificial airway. • ECG, respiratory rate, blood pressure, SpO , and CO are monitored continuously. 2 ET 2 • The patient's temperature is monitored continuously using either a rectal probe or skin electrode. High and low temperature alarm limits should be set, and alarms active. • It is preferable that the patient have a functional arterial line, but the placement of an arterial line should not delay the initiation of isoflurane. • The patient requires adequate vascular access for emergency medication administration and fluid administration. • The High Risk Suctioning guideline should be followed. Prior to suctioning, patients with asthma may benefit from a suctioning premedication regimen consisting of instilled lidocaine and IV ketamine. • A closed in-line suction catheter will be used for artificial airway suctioning. • The effects of muscle relaxants are potentiated with isoflurane. If the patient is receiving neuromuscular blockade, the level of chemical paralysis will be assessed daily using train-of-four monitoring or a ""holiday"" period off paralytics, per the Neuromuscular Blockade policy. • Non-emergent disconnections from the anesthesia system should be avoided in order to avoid acute reversal of bronchodilator and sedative effect, and potential environmental exposure. A closed in-line suction catheter will be used for artificial airway suctioning.",• Only patients with an artificial airway who require assisted ventilation are considered for in-line suctioning. • Patients requiring assisted ventilation will be assessed by a nurse and a respiratory therapist at the beginning of each shift. A suction plan is made based on the patient's condition; including the decision to perform open or closed suctioning and the importance and procedure for pre-oxygenation. See the Suctioning an Artificial Airway: Open Suction of an Endotracheal Tube or Tracheostomy Tube . • Use the High Risk Suctioning Procedure for patients with following diagnosis or clinical needs: ◦ Air leak syndrome ◦ HFOV/HFJV ◦ Pulmonary hypertension ◦ iNO ◦ Low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) ◦ Hemodynamic instability requiring multiple vasopressors ◦ PEEP dependent patients that have demonstrated desaturation upon disconnection from the ventilator or have a prolonged recovery time ◦ Congenital diaphragmatic hernia ◦ Critical airway ◦ Inhaled anesthetic or heliox therapy ◦ Shunted single ventricle patient ◦ < 1 year of age for the first 24 hours following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) ◦ Known or risk for left atrial (LA) hypertension as identified by CICU attending and/or attending surgeon • In-line suction catheters are changed weekly and as needed.,"Resuscitation ambu bag Connect resuscitation bag to blender and adjust to 100%. • For routine open suctioning of infants <36 weeks gestation, FiO on the blender should be turned down to 2 10-20% above the patient's baseline FiO during manual ventilation. The blender FiO should then be 2 2 adjusted back to 100% FiO once suctioning is completed. 2 • For patients with congenital cardiac defects who are at risk of over circulation, FiO2 on the blender should be turned down to 10-20% above the patient's baseline during routine manual ventilation. The blender FiO should then be adjusted back to 100% FiO once manual ventilation is completed. A sign should be 2 2 placed at the bedside indicating the above statement. Nasal Cannula 2 Prior to initiating nasal cannula, the multidisciplinary NICU team discusses whether the patient requires flow or oxygen to maintain SpO within NICU parameters. Patients receive stable oxygen delivery vs. stable flow 2 delivery. • Stable oxygen delivery: ◦ Flow meter is connected to an oxygen source (no blender) and flow is titrated to maintain SpO 2 within NICU parameters. • Stable flow delivery: ◦ Very-low-flow flowmeter is connected to a blender, and the blender titrated to maintain SpO within 2 NICU parameters. ◦ This method is recommended for those patients with retinopathy of prematurity or those who are unable to maintain SpO within NICU parameters either in room air or with standard 30 mL/min NC 2 connected to at 100%. 2 ◦ For these infants, the resuscitation bag is connected to an alternate 100% oxygen source.",4,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

Preoperative antibiotics Appropriate antibiotics to cover common organisms are needed. One study has suggested that use of clindamycin increases risk of infection. There are several studies as discussed above that have demonstrated a high rate of gram negative infections, and therefore coverage for these organisms makes sense. In addition, appropriate timing of antibiotic dosing is critical, as inappropriate dosing as defined as antibiotics given greater than 60 minutes prior to incision represent a risk of infection. The current recommendations of the AAOS are to use appropriate antibiotics for 24 hours postoperatively. One study failed to demonstrate a benefit of continuing antibiotics beyond 24 hours when a drain is in place. References 24.

How should the nurses maintain patient and team member safety during the delivery of electrical therapy as per the hospital policy,0,"Staffing plans are developed based on the American Nurses Association principles of Nurse Staffing, third edition (2020). These principles include the characteristics and considerations of the healthcare consumer, the registered nurses, and other interprofessional team members and staff. Other influencing factors include the organizational approach to the delivery of nursing care services and the practice environment on the delivery of care (ANA, 2020). Therapies, services, and activities related to patient care reflect the needs of the patient and their families with consideration for any physical and psychosocial limitations. The staffing plan considers the number of patients and the resources required to deliver the needed level of care to all patients. The principle needs of the patient population influence and determine the competencies required for safe nursing practice on an ongoing basis. Unit and hospital based leadership provide added structure and guidance in the development of competencies which are evaluated on a regular basis. Additionally, the hospital maintains policies, which are also reviewed on a routine basis, that support the needs and safety of patients and nursing staff. The nurse staffing for the Inpatient Cardiology unit includes registered nurses and clinical assistants. Registered nurses range in experience from new graduate nurses to more than 30 years of clinical practice. Attention is given to keeping 80% of the nursing staff with at least 2 years of clinical experience. The nurses on the Inpatient Cardiology unit work 12-hour shifts to provide continuity and optimal support of patient flow on the unit. Daily staffing plans are adapted to accommodate the current census and number of higher acuity patients; a combination of 1:2 and 1:3 assignments are constructed to provide the appropriate nursing hours to more complex patients. Staffing plans and patient assignments are informed by an evidenced based acuity and nursing workload tool. Staff nurses self-schedule their hours. The shifts are then balanced by the ""time scheduler"", a designated staff nurse, to ensure there is an appropriate composition of total staff numbers, skill mix, and experience. Each shift has a dedicated charge nurse who provides oversight to the daily flow and operations of our unit including real time staffing needs and clinical support. Additionally, clinical support is provided by the 1-3 resource nurses who are scheduled for each shift based on availability and need. All staff are well versed in utilizing the chain of command when additional clinical or leadership support is required. Ongoing evaluation of the staffing plan is driven by trends identified via nurse-sensitive indicators, which help to evaluate its effectiveness. Furthermore, ""staffing plans must be conducive to adjustment to reflect changes in evidence and outcomes, care scenarios, and the needs of the population served, all of which can vary from hour to hour, day to day, and shift to shift (ANA, 2020 p. 16)."" All staff are encouraged to pursue advancement through the clinical advancement ladder. On average, 25-30% of the unit's staff nurses are promoted to either Staff Nurse II or III. Also known as the ""Leadership group,"" these members act as clinical leaders by participating in the development, implementation, and evaluation of unit goals. More formal leadership, education, and clinical supervision is provided by a core team of nurse educators, nurse practice specialists, a clinical research coordinator, and clinical coordinators. Unit level leaders report to a Nurse Director and the Vice President for Cardiovascular and Critical Care Programs. Residents and fellows or nurse practitioners manage the cardiac medical patients. Nurse practitioners manage the cardiac surgical patients. All provider structures are under the direction of either an attending cardiac surgeon or attending cardiologist. Case Managers are responsible for supporting discharge planning and utilization review processes. Hospital supports such as administrative staff, phone devices, transport services, housekeeping, food services, phlebotomy and laboratory services, and hospital workstations reduce the amount of time spent away from patient care.","1. Boston Children's Hospital Magnet Safety Committee assumes responsibility to establish guidelines and credential all providers, hospital personnel, and visitors entering the perioperative Magnet Resonance Imaging Operating Room (MR OR). 2.

Does our hospital perform onsite cannulation for ECMO and if not what is the protocol for transporting patients who have been cannulated at a referring facility,0,"Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is the application of a modified cardiopulmonary bypass circuit designed for long-term use to patients with cardiac and/or respiratory failure who have not responded to conventional measures or treatments. There are 2 types of ECMO, veno-arterial (VA) which provides cardiac and pulmonary support and veno-venous (VV) which provides pulmonary support. Patients on ECMO may be cannulated through the vessels of the neck, groin or via open chest. The BCH CCTT has the capability to transport patients who have been successfully cannulated at the referring facility and are deemed appropriate candidates for transport. BCH does not provide on-site cannulation at referring hospitals.","1. Patient weight >100 kg 2. Patient is ECMO candidate but cannot be cannulated by the referring facility 3.

The CCTT is not part of the pre-hospital care system and therefore does not respond to 911 calls or requests for ""freelance responses"". Acceptable Facilities for Critical Care Transport Team Response 04.05 In order to ensure referred patients receive prompt and appropriate care, the CCTT requires patients to be in an acute care facility where stabilizing care can be provided until CCTT arrival. The CCTT serves the New England area and can often have an estimated time of arrival of 1-2 hours to some locations. For the patient's safety, the CCTT does NOT respond to home addresses, community physician's offices, or other non-acute care facilities. Exceptions are listed below. • Boston Children's Hospital satellites • Franciscan Children's Hospital • Free standing Emergency Departments (ex. Seabrook ED) Under exceptional circumstances, the CCTT Medical Director may approve transport from another non-acute facility. Vendor Ambulance Service 04.11 The Boston Children's Hospital Critical Care Transport Team (CCTT) utilizes the Boston Children's ambulances for all transport calls. In the event that the Boston Children's ambulances are out of service (OOS) for any reason or a second Transport Team is available and needs an ambulance to perform a transport, the CCTT has contracted with Cataldo Ambulance for these services. Boston MedFlight Transport Calls 04.13 When the Medical Control Physician (MCP), the referring physician, and the Critical Care Transport Team (CCTT) are in agreement that the patient would be best served by a more expeditious transport, BMF's services of rotor-wing and fixed-wing air transports can be requested. Long Distance Transports 06.07 To ensure patient and crew safety on long distance transports where duty time and fatigue may impact patient care, the maximum number of hours worked by any BCH CCTT member continuously is 16 hours. There must be a minimum 10-hour rest period between on duty shifts worked. The maximum driving time for one Team member on any one transport call is 6 hours round trip. If the driving time is expected to exceed 6 hours, an additional driver must be added to the Team configuration. Stretcher Weight Limit Policy 09.08 The Critical Care Transport Team (CCTT) will maintain safe practice and mechanics when transporting the bariatric patient. Patients exceeding 400 lbs (181 kg) and/or a width of 23 inches (58 cm) cannot be transported safely using the CCTT patient transport stretcher. Other means to safely transport the patient will need to be arranged utilizing an ambulance service specializing in bariatric transport. Transport of the Combative Patient or Family Member 08.06 In accordance with Boston Children's Hospital Critical Care Transport Team policy 08.06, patients and/or family members will not be transported if they pose a physical threat to staff, vehicle and/or themselves during transport. All cases will be discussed with referring facility attending physician, BCH CCTT Medical Control Physician, BCH CCTT Medical Director, BCH CCTT nursing management on call and medical crew prior to transport. Mobile ECMO Transport Request 08.07 The request for mobile ECMO transport may be declined after discussion with the Medical Control Physician based on the following criteria: • Patient weight >100 kg • Patient is ECMO candidate but cannot be cannulated by the referring facility • Uncontrolled bleeding (consult with Medical Control Physician (MCP)/Attending Physician) • Documented or suspected major neurologic injury (consult with MCP/Attending Physician) • Transport request to a facility other than Boston Children's Hospital • Inability to properly staff Mobile ECMO team • Distance too great for ground transport (consult with Nursing Management)",3,2,2,0,2,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
What are the potential risks associated with holding enteral feeds around packed RBC transfusions for very low birth weight infants,1,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious inflammatory condition of the intestine that affects up to 10% of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. 1 Many factors contribute to the development of NEC but the exact pathogenesis is not clear. Transfusion-associated NEC (TANEC) or transfusion associated gut injury (TRAGI) refers to NEC episodes that are temporally related (within 48 hours) to RBC transfusion. 2,3 TANEC is estimated to account for 20-35% of NEC episodes, 4 and compared to infants with NEC unrelated to RBC transfusion, TANEC is associated with increased need for surgical intervention, longer hospitalization, and higher mortality. 3,5,6 Several mechanisms for TANEC have been proposed including severe anemia leading to impaired blood flow to the gut, exposure to immunological mediators in transfused blood that trigger an immune reaction, and ischemia/reperfusion injury associated with RBC transfusion. 7,8 Multiple meta-analyses over the past 10 years have attempted to determine the association between RBC transfusions and NEC with conflicting results. 6,9-11 In addition, subsequent clinical and pre-clinical studies have suggested that both the severity of anemia and the RBC transfusion together increase the risk of TANEC. 2,12,13 Due to the uncertainty regarding the casual association of RBC transfusion and NEC, many NICUs have adopted the practice of holding enteral feeds peri-transfusion in hopes of minimizing any potential risk of developing TANEC. Over the past ~7 years multiple observational studies and one small randomized controlled trial (RCT) have been performed to investigate the association between feeding during RBC transfusion and the risk of developing TANEC. The findings from these studies are conflicting and with limitations [ see table in related content for full descriptions ]. The Withholding Enteral Feeds Around packed RBC Transfusion (WHEAT) point of care pilot trial has finished initial enrollment at two centers in the UK and may expand to a larger, multicenter trial pending analysis of feasibility outcomes. This study randomized infants born at <30 weeks gestational age to continue enteral feeds (per unit guideline) during transfusion or hold enteral feeds 4 hours before, during, and 4 hours after transfusion until a post menstrual age of 34+6 weeks. Clinical outcomes (including severe NEC, spontaneous intestinal preformation, all-cause mortality, duration of parenteral nutrition, number of days with central venous line, number of line associated blood stream infection, and growth) will be assessed from randomization to 40+0 weeks of gestation, or unit discharge, whichever occurs first. This trial should provide further information to guide feeding practices during RBC transfusions. The wide variation in the currently available evidence and available feeding protocols makes it difficult to determine the best feeding practices around and during RBC transfusions. Stopping enteral feedings is not without risk (prolonging time to reach full milk feeds which is associated with infection and can also be associated with increased risk of NEC). Until further evidence is available, it is reasonable to implement enteral feeding guidelines similar to those under investigation in the WHEAT trial.","• Currently available data from randomized controlled trials of red cell transfusion thresholds only includes infants < 32 weeks (or with a birth weight <1500g) until PMA of 36 weeks and little to no data is available to guide transfusion decisions in infants born outside of these parameters. • Low hemoglobin is commonly interpreted as a marker of diminished carrying capacity and impaired 2 tissue oxygenation ◦ Particularly important in neonates with developing and growing body • Besides the general risks (transfusion associated lung injury, transfusion associated circulatory overload, excessive iron load, infection, hemolytic reactions), transfusions may carry further risks in preterms. • consumption may be higher in critically ill compared with stable neonates. 2 • Thresholds for RBC transfusion used in local guidelines should be within the thresholds used across clinical trials - the safety of these thresholds is established. • The best available evidence to date, from the TOP and ETTNO trials, suggest there to be no difference in survival without neurodevelopmental impairment at 22 to 26 months of age between infants transfused at higher hemoglobin transfusion thresholds compared to lower. The proposed guidelines are within the ranges used in the TOP and ETTNO studies for those specific populations studied in the trials. • These guidelines DO NOT apply to cases of acute bleeding or anticipated bleeding (perioperative).","Eligibility Very preterm neonate <32weeks gestational age Very low birth weight (<1500 grams) infants Infants with a history of necrotizing enterocolitis who are resuming feeds Infants with congenital heart disease and/or congenital gastrointestinal anomalies that put them at risk of developing ischemic bowel Term hospitalized neonates as a bridge to maintain exclusive human milk feedings Duration of Use The minimum duration that infants are recommended to receive donor human milk as a supplement to mother's own milk is: For the entire period of early trophic feeding AND; Until 7 days after the infant reaches 150ml/kg/day or maximum tolerated enteral feedings AND; For very preterm or very low birth weight infants, until the infant reaches 32 weeks postmenstrual age and/or 1500 grams Up to 7 days as Bridge Milk nutritional therapy; no transition period required Transition Protocol If mother's own milk remains unavailable or inadequate once the minimum duration is completed, wean the donor human milk and provide supplemental formula over a 3 day period: Day 1 – supplement 1 of every 4 feedings with formula Day 2 – supplement 2 of every 4 feedings with formula Day 3 – supplement 3 of every 4 feedings with formula","Enteral Nutrition during Transfusion: • Until additional data becomes available, enteral nutrition is recommended to be withheld 3-4 hours before, during, and 3-4 hours after transfusion (depending on every 3-4 hours feeding schedule): in practice, patients are going to miss two enteral feedings. • Data suggests that RBC transfusions provide a minimal glucose infusion rate (GIR) of 0.08 – 2 mg/kg/ min. The majority of infants will need supplemental glucose containing fluids while feeds are held, but this is per clinical discretion. • After withholding feeds, enteral nutrition should be resumed at the same level as prior to transfusion.","1.

Many health care organizations have endorsed the practice of parent and / or family presence including the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Association of Critical Care Nurses and the American Heart Association to name a few. Staff education, the use of parent facilitators and development of practice guidelines support the family and clinician’s experience of parent presence. Parent presence has been shown in the literature to improve parental satisfaction with care, improved parental coping and understanding of a procedure or resuscitation event and bereavement adjustment.

Boston Children's Hospital's Regulatory Affairs, in conjunction with the IRB, will determine whether the justification is sufficient to proceed, or whether confirmation by the FDA is necessary. 2. Investigators are advised to review the FDA Guidance document, Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) — Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND . Investigator Responsibilities Responsibilities of an investigator participating in a study under an IND are detailed in Subpart D of 21 CFR 312. For all investigations subject to IND regulations: 1. The investigator is required to be knowledgeable about the requirements of FDA regulations and 2. Must be listed on a FDA Form 1572 in order to administer an investigational product. At the time of continuing review, the IRB may request additional documentation to be confirm the investigator is following the IND requirements. Sponsor-Investigators Responsibilities Regulatory responsibilities for investigators and sponsors are detailed in 21 CRR 312 subpart D. A Sponsor- Investigator is responsible for all requirements as both a sponsor and an investigator. 1. Prior to approval of a protocol in which the IND is held by a Sponsor-Investigator, there are two requirements: a. Boston Children's Hospital's Regulatory Affairs will conduct sponsor responsibility training with the Sponsor-Investigator b. A IND/IDE Resource Group (IIRG) Meeting will be held.","It is the responsibility of the Sponsor-Investigator to submit an IND application to the FDA for studies which must be conducted under an IND. The IND application must contain information in three broad areas: 1. Animal Pharmacology and Toxicology Studies - Preclinical data to permit an assessment as to whether the product is reasonably safe for initial testing in humans. For many Sponsor-Investigator (or investigator-initiated INDs), this requirement can be met by submitting a Letter of Authorization cross- referencing a third party's regulatory application. Also included in the IND are data on any previous experience with the drug in humans. 2. Manufacturing Information - Information pertaining to the composition, manufacturer, stability, and controls used for manufacturing the drug substance and the drug product. This information is assessed to ensure that the company can adequately produce and supply consistent batches of the drug. For many Sponsor-Investigator (or investigator-initiated INDs), this requirement can be met by submitting a Letter of Authorization cross-referencing a third party's regulatory application. 3. Clinical Protocols and Investigator Information - Detailed protocols for proposed clinical studies to assess whether the initial-phase trials will expose subjects to unnecessary risks. Also, information on the qualifications of clinical investigators to assess whether they are qualified to fulfill their clinical trial duties. Finally, commitments to obtain informed consent from the research subjects, to obtain review of the study by an institutional review board (IRB), and to adhere to the investigational new drug regulations. Boston Children's Hospital Internal Review Process The IND/IDE Resource Group (IIRG) is a group of experts from across the hospital that internally reviews the IND application prior to submitting to the FDA. All Investigators seeking to submit an IND to the FDA will first be required to participate in this internal review process to: 1. Review the proposed protocol 2. Review requirements of the institution and of sponsoring an IND 3. Provide recommendations for how the Investigator can meet their regulatory obligations. FDA Submission 1. Once the IND is submitted, the sponsor must wait 30 calendar days before initiating any clinical trials. 2. During this time, the FDA has the opportunity to review the IND for safety to assure that research subjects will not be subjected to unreasonable risk. 3. At the end of this 30-day review period, the FDA may issue a ""Study May Proceed"" letter or a clinical hold letter. Information to be submitted with the IRB Application Complete IND information must be submitted with any protocol submitted to the IRB that involves an investigational drug or biologic. 1. Investigators are required to submit IND information provided by the sponsor, or if the investigator is also the sponsor a copy of the letter from the FDA that assigns the IND. 2. The IRB will not release a final approval until all IND information is complete. 3. Protocol administrators will be responsible for making sure this information is obtained prior to release of the IRB approval notification and informed consent document. 4. If there is any question as to whether an IND is required, the IRB may require, as part of the review and approval process, that the investigator contact a Boston Children's Hospital Regulatory Affairs Specialist or the FDA to discuss the protocol and to determine if an IND is required. 5. Investigators who propose to use investigational or marketed drugs for unapproved indications must also follow FDA regulations 21 CFR 50 and 56. a. For the most part, the FDA regulations are the same as HHS regulations 45 CFR 46. The regulations are similar with regard to IRB organization, composition, procedure, record keeping, and criteria for approval of research protocol, and informed consent documentation. b. At the time of a continuing review, if an investigator is the sponsor of an IND, a copy of the annual report to the FDA will be requested.","Expanded Access of Investigational Drugs The use of investigational drugs and biologics is usually limited to subjects enrolled in clinical trials under an Investigational New Drug (IND). However, test articles may show some promise before the trials are completed. When there is no satisfactory standard treatment for a serious, life-threatening, or a debilitating condition, the FDA has a mechanism that allows expanded access to the drugs before the clinical trials are complete. When no satisfactory alternative treatment exists, subjects are generally willing to accept greater risks from test articles that may treat life-threatening and debilitating illnesses. The following mechanisms expand access to promising therapeutic agents without compromising the protection afforded to human subjects, or the thoroughness and scientific integrity of product development and marketing approval. 1. 21 CFR 312 Subpart I: Expanded access use of an Investigational New Drug (IND) 2. 21 CFR 314: Drug products 3. 21 CFR 600: Biological products Emergency Use INDs In instances where a patient needs to be treated before a written application can be submitted, the FDA can grant an emergency IND. Researchers should use the FDA's website for the comprehensive process. 1. Once an Emergency Use IND is granted, the physician-sponsor has 15 calendar days to submit the written application to the FDA. 2. The Emergency Use IND must be reported to the Boston Children's Hospital IRB within 5 working days. a. Any subsequent use of the test article is subject to IRB review prior to initiation of treatment. The emergency use of a test article, other than a medical device, is a clinical investigation, the patient is a participant, and the FDA may require data from an emergency use to be reported in a marketing application. However, HHS regulations do not permit data obtained from patients to be classified as research involving human participants, nor permit the outcome of such care to be included in any report of a research activity subject to HHS regulations. FDA Exemption Federal law requires that a drug be the subject of an approved marketing application before it is transported or distributed across state lines. Because there is likelihood that a sponsor will want to ship the investigational drug to clinical investigators in other states, the investigator must seek an exemption from that legal requirement. The Investigational New Drug (IND) is the means through which the sponsor technically obtains this exemption from the FDA (21 CFR 312). This requirement applies to any expanded access mechanism obtaining the drug/biologic. Informed Consent The FDA requires informed consent to be obtained from the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, unless both the physician-investigator and a physician who is not otherwise participating in the clinical investigation certify in writing all of the following (21 CFR 50.23(a)): 1. The subject is confronted by a life-threatening situation necessitating the use of the test article. 2. Informed consent cannot be obtained because of an inability to communicate with, or obtain legally effective consent from, the subject. 3. Time is not sufficient to obtain consent from the subject's legal representative. 4. No alternative method of approved or generally recognized therapy is available that provides an equal or greater likelihood of saving the subject's life. Intermediate-Size Patient Population Access In cases where more than a single patient will be treated with an investigational product (but fewer than a treatment IND/protocol), an intermediate-size patient population expanded access IND or protocol can be submitted to the IRB via CHeRP as a New Research Activity. a. An intermediate-size patient population IND is traditionally submitted by a single physician to treat multiple patients. b. The investigational product may or may not be under development for marketing. Treatment IND/Protocol A treatment IND (21 CFR 312.34 and 312.35) is a mechanism for providing eligible subjects with investigational drugs for the treatment of serious and life-threatening illnesses for which there are no satisfactory alternative treatments. A treatment IND may be granted after sufficient data have been collected to show that the drug ""may be effective"" and does not have unreasonable risks. Data related to safety and side effects are collected, treatment INDs also serve to expand the body of knowledge about the drug. There are four requirements that must be met before a treatment IND can be issued: 1. The drug is intended to treat a serious or immediately life-threatening disease. 2. There is no satisfactory alternative treatment available. 3. The drug is already under investigation, or trials have been completed. 4. The trial sponsor is actively pursuing marketing approval. A sponsor may apply for a waiver of local IRB review under a treatment IND, if justified to be in the best interest of the subjects and if a satisfactory alternate mechanism for assuring the protection of human subjects is available (i.e. review by a central IRB). Such a waiver does not apply to the informed consent requirement. An IRB may still opt to review a study even if FDA has granted a waiver. It is also possible for a treatment protocol to be submitted under an existing IND for that investigational product. The same requirements are required for a treatment protocol. Treatment INDs and treatment protocols should be submitted to the IRB in CHeRP as New Research Activity.","Research at Boston Children's Hospital that involves the investigational use of drugs, biologics, and dietary supplements must conform to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regulations, and Massachusetts state regulations (94C MGL 8). FDA regulations have additional requirements for clinical investigations that involve the use of an approved product or biologic, if it is used in a manner for which it is not approved. FDA regulations for investigational new drug (IND) requirements are outlined in 21 CFR 312. Regulations on drug products can be found in 21 CFR 314 and regulations on biological products are in 21 CFR 600. State regulations (94C MGL 8) require the registration of investigators who use investigational and Schedule II drugs in research protocols. Current federal law requires that a drug be the subject of an approved marketing application before it is transported or distributed across state lines. Because a sponsor will most likely ship the investigational drug to clinical investigators in other states, they must seek an exemption from that legal requirement. 1. The IND is the means through which the sponsor technically obtains an exemption from the FDA. 2. The IND regulations are detailed in 21 CFR 312.",4,2,3,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

According to the policy who is ultimately responsible for ensuring that all delegates have appropriate training experience and competence to undertake medical management,0,"1. During an admission, a patient shall only have one attending medical staff member who is ultimately responsible for all medical decisions. 2. The attending medical staff member may request a consultation so that the patient may benefit from a consultant's assessment, recommendations, and/or procedural expertise. 3. If the attending medical staff member, after review/agreement with the consultant, determines that the patient should be transferred to the consultant's service, the Change of Service Policy process must be followed. 4. If the medical management plan is delegated, in whole or part, the attending medical staff member and/or the consultant who is delegating services continues to remain responsible for ensuring that all delegates have appropriate training, experience and competence to undertake such management.","1. The attending physician develops a plan for the medical management of each patient in conjunction with the house staff and consulting services. 2.

If the attending physician delegates, in whole or in part, the medical management plan, the attending remains responsible for ensuring that all delegates have appropriate training, experience and competence to undertake such management. 4. The attending physician communicates clearly to each trainee involved in the care of the patient when the attending expects to be contacted by the trainee. At a minimum, trainees are told to notify the attending physician of significant changes in the patient's condition, regardless of the time of day or day of week. Significant changes may include, but are not limited to the following: a. Admission to hospital b. Transfer of patient to ICU c. Need for intubation or ventilatory support d.

When should a bolus feeding be administered via an enteral feeding pump instead of by gravity,1,"Many infants and children can tolerate bolus tube feedings by gravity run over 20 to 30 minutes. If a patient has reflux or vomiting, administer a bolus feeding via an enteral feeding pump over a longer period. Refer to the Patient Care Manual: Enteral Feeding Using a Pump . • Use one of the following to administer enteral feedings by gravity: ◦ Gravity administration set (e.g., 1000 mL, 500 mL or bottle) ◦ Appropriate size syringe with the plunger removed",1. Administer feedings via an enteral pump (either Kangaroo® or Medfusion®) continuously or bolus over 30 to 60 minutes. 2. Use Medfusion ® enteral pump for gastric refeeds. 3. Administer bolus feedings per prescriber order instead of continuous feeds whenever possible. 4. Refer to The Patient Care Manual: Administration of Medication by the Enteral Tube Route for information regarding administering medications by the enteral route.,"1. Use an enteral feeding pump (either Kangaroo® or Medfusion®) for patients who cannot tolerate gravity feeds administered over 20 to 30 minutes. 2. Administer enteral feedings through enteral syringe feeding tubing or through an enteral feeding bag attached directly to the feeding tube. 3. DO NOT use intravenous tubing for enteral feeds to prevent the inadvertent administration of enteral feeding via the intravenous route. 4. Use an enteral syringe and enteral syringe feeding tubing via the Medfusion ® enteral syringe pump to administer human milk feeds and formulas with oil added. Note: Avoid using enteral feeding bags for patients on human milk. When feasible, consider changing the syringe every 2 hours before changing the delivery method to an enteral feeding bag. 5. Ensure Oxygen and suction equipment are available at the patient bedside at all times.","• Administer enteral feedings through enteral syringe feeding tubing or through an enteral feeding bag attached directly to the feeding tube. • To prevent inadvertent administration of enteral feeding via the intravenous route, do not use intravenous tubing for enteral feeds • Administer gravity feedings into the stomach only by nasogastric, orogastric, or gastrostomy tube when the patient has inadequate oral intake. • Ensure oxygen and suction equipment are available at the patient bedside at all times.","• Breast milk is the feeding type of choice. If breast milk is unavailable, donor human milk should be used according to the Use of Donor Human Milk policy. If the infant is not eligible for donor human milk or the parents decline it, formula should be used. • Typically, gastric feeding should be initiated as a bolus over 15-30 minutes every 3 hours. For breast milk, feeding over longer duration leads to separation of the milk components, clinging of fat to tubing, and loss of nutrients. • Continuous feedings are also acceptable. Specific reasons to consider bolus feeding over >30 minutes, or continuous feeding, include: ◦ Malabsorption. Continuous feeds may improve absorption in short bowel syndrome, and enteral feeding is important for bowel adaptation, prevention and treatment of parenteral nutrition associated liver disease, and reduction in sepsis. ◦ GERD associated with complications or refractory to medical therapy ◦ Signs of feeding tolerance with bolus feeds, such as recurrent vomiting or abdominal distension • Post-pyloric feedings should be given continuously due to the inability of the small intestine to expand to accommodate a bolus feeding. • Guidelines for initiation and advancement of enteral feeding volumes are listed in the table and in the bulleted list below: Weight (grams) Initial Rate ml/kg/day Volume Increase up to ml/kg/day < 1000 10 15-20 1001-1250 10 20 1251-1500 20 20 1501-1800 30 30 1801-2500 40 40 >2500 50 50 • Full feeding volume is 150 mL/kg/day. Target energy intake is 110-130 kcal/kg/day, and target protein intake is 4.0 to 4.5 g/kg for infants < 1000 g, and 3.5 to 4.0 g/kg for infants 1000 to 1500 g. • Guidelines for the fortification of human milk and use of infant formula are available in the online Pediatric Nutrition Care Manual , section on Preterm Infants . These include tables outlining macronutrient and micronutrient needs. • Consider volume >150 mL/kg/d based on nutritional needs (macronutrient, calorie), infant hunger, weight gain, and ability to tolerate additional fluid volume vs. caloric density. • Consider volume <150 mL/kg/day in special circumstances, for example to achieve fluid restriction in infants with chronic lung disease. Caloric density should be increased to achieve target growth. • The initial feeding volume should be given for 12-24 hours prior to advancement. • Once feeding volume has reached 100 mL/kg/day, strongly consider increasing caloric density to 24 kcals /oz, particularly for infants <1500 grams; advancement of volume may proceed more rapidly (up to 15 mL/ kg q 12 hours for infants <1500 grams). • When feeding is interrupted temporarily (e.g. for a procedure or blood transfusion), feedings may be resumed and re-advanced more quickly than when feedings are first initiated. • If no contraindication, infants meeting criteria for oral feeding (See Routes of Enteral Feeding section above) may be offered oral feeding ad lib at the discretion of the medical team. ◦ Whenever possible, oral feeds should initiated as soon as the infant develops signs of feeding readiness. ◦ For infants unable to take the full volume by mouth, oral feeds should be offered prior to gastric bolus feeds, and target volumes should be set as a combined oral and enteral goal.",4,4,4,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

Adult:70/min 7. Gradually increase the energy dosing until another team member is able to palpate a central pulse at the pre-set rate. 8. If there is no ""capture"" (ie: no palpable pulse despite electrical complexes) at maximum energy doses, discontinue pacing efforts and contact the Medical Control Physician","1. Evaluate the airway and provide management according to the CCTT Neonatal Airway Management protocol. 2. Provide supplemental oxygen: a. Monitor pulse oximetry and adjust oxygen administration to maintain oxygen saturations according to the following guidelines: i. Term and near term (>35 weeks) infants: SpO2 >95% ii. Preterm infants (<34 weeks): SpO2 90 – 95% b. If congenital heart disease is suspected, refer to the CCTT Newborn with Suspected Congenital Heart Disease protocol for guidelines regarding oxygen saturation goals. 3. Provide ventilatory assistance to infants who are unable to maintain adequate oxygen saturations despite a FiO2 >0.6, or who have significantly increased work of breathing or signs of respiratory failure. a. Consider facial or nasal CPAP or BIPAP. b. Initiate positive pressure ventilation by bag and mask for infants with signs of inadequate ventilation. Whenever possible, use a manometer to monitor airway pressures. c. Perform endotracheal intubation when indicated according to the CCTT Neonatal Airway Management protocol. 4. For infants who are endotracheally intubated, provide ventilatory support using the following guidelines for initial management: a. Peak inspiratory pressure adequate to create chest rise and breath sounds. In general: i. Term infant: 20 – 30 cm H2O ii. Pre-term infant: 15 – 20 cm H2O NOTE: Patients with poor lung compliance may require higher initial inflating pressures, which should be adjusted as pulmonary function improves. b. Positive end-expiratory pressure at 4 – 5 cm H2O; consider increasing to 6 – 8 cm H2O for infants with pulmonary hemorrhage. c. Ventilation rate – adjust based on assessment of the infant's rate and effort, blood gases, and EtCO2. In general, the goal for pH is >7.25 and <7.40, except for patients with PPHN (refer to the CCTT Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn protocol). In general, starting ventilatory rates are as follows: 1. Term infant: 20 – 30/min 2. Pre-term infant: 30 – 40/min Note: I:E ratio will change with rate, but should not exceed 1:1. d. FiO2 – adjust based on pulse oximetry, using guidelines in #2 above. 5. For pre-term neonates (≤35 weeks) with respiratory failure and evidence of respiratory distress syndrome by radiologic evaluation (ground glass appearance, low lung volumes, air bronchograms), administer exogenous surfactant as described below. For term or near-term infants (>35 weeks), consult with the Medical Control Physician prior to surfactant administration. 6. Transport nurses may administer Curosurf® (poractant alfa) intratracheally at a dose of 2.5 mL/kg following the Boston Children's Hospital Standards for the Administration of Surfactant Replacement Therapy. 7. Especially after the administration of surfactant the infant should be observed closely during transport for changes in lung compliance and oxygenation, so that peak inspiratory pressure can be adjusted to prevent over-distension, which may result in pneumothorax, and FiO2 can be adjusted according to pulse oximetry, based on the guidelines in #2 above. 8. If a clinically significant pneumothorax is suspected or proven to be present, perform needle thoracentesis according to the CCTT Pleural Decompression protocol. Consult with the Medical Control Physician regarding placement of a chest tube following needle thoracentesis. 9. For neonates with suspected conditions that are addressed in other protocols, refer to the applicable protocol for further care (eg: Tracheoesophageal Fistula and Esophageal Atresia, Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia, Newborn with Suspected Congenital Heart Disease, Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn ). 10. Perform frequent reassessment of the patient during transport, and adjust therapy as needed based on the clinical condition.","Air Embolism Etiology 1. Air bubbles leading to air embolism to the patient and circuit air-lock are either visually observed or detected by the bubble detector. Air embolism can be caused by: a. Loose connections on drainage side of circuit b. During injection or infusion of medications or blood products both into the patient as well as the circuit c. Large negative pressure on drainage side d. Unplanned venous decannulation or disruption of the ECMO circuit e. During cannula manipulation f. Cath Lab procedures Management Patient 1. For all cases of suspected air embolism obtain an echocardiogram at the discretion of the Intensivist to determine if air is entrapped in the heart (if bubble detector is activated). 2. Place the patient in Trendelenburg position if hemodynamics and patient movement permits to minimize air travelling to the brain. Removing micro emboli 1. Micro emboli can be removed with a syringe from available ports. Remove cap on membrane de-airing port Unplanned drainage decannulation or circuit disruption Large amounts of air can be quickly entrained into the ECMO circuit during an unplanned venous or LA-vent decannulation, and may be sufficient to cause an air lock. 1. Open the cover to the pump to stop flow on the roller pump, or clamp circuit on the centrifugal pump. 2. Separate the patient from the ECMO circuit, by clamping the venous and arterial limb of the ECMO circuit and open the bridge to allow ECMO flow through it. 3. Support ventilation and hemodynamics. 4. Apply pressure to cannula site and STAT page surgeon. Flood the surgical field with normal saline for open chest cannulations. 5. Move vital drugs from circuit to patient and replace lost intravascular volume for the patient. 6. Attempt to confine air to venous side of circuit. Evacuate air from available ports. 7. Proceed with a rapid-response clear-primed circuit change if amount of air is too excessive to evacuate. Unplanned De-cannulation An unplanned de-cannulation may occur from disruption of the retaining sutures or during patient movement. 1. Separate the patient from the ECMO circuit, and stop flow by either lifting the lid on the roller pump or clamping the circuit on the centrifugal pump. 2. Support ventilation and hemodynamics. 3. Apply pressure to cannula site and STAT page surgeon and medical team. 4. Move vital drugs from circuit to patient and replace lost intravascular volume to maintain hemodynamics. 5. Maintain circuit and watch for air, by flowing through the bridge 6. Obtain replacement cannula and prepare for re-cannulation. Membrane Failure Alteration in gas exchange Pre- and post-membrane blood gases are simultaneously obtained when acute and unexpected changes in the patient's blood gases occur. 1. A significant decrease in post-membrane PO2 may indicate a decrease in function. 2. A decrease in the difference in the pre- and post-membrane PCO2 may occur if there is increased water accumulation in the membrane. Flush the membrane by increasing the sweep gas briefly to 3lpm for the infant membrane or 10lpm for adult membrane, while looking for moisture to come out of the exhalation port. 3. If membrane performance continues to decline, prepare for a membrane change or a circuit change if using the centrifugal pump. Changes in membrane pressures Monitor pre- and post-membrane pressures at all times. 1. An increase in pre-membrane pressure with no change in post-membrane indicates an increase in resistance in the membrane, typically caused by clotting. 2. A decreasing difference between pre- and post-membrane pressures may indicate a decrease in roller pump occlusion. 3. An increase in both pre- and post-membrane pressures represents an increase arterial line resistance, pressure and/or flow (like in a hemofilter clotting off). 4. If acute changes in membrane pressures occurs, a pre- and post-membrane blood gas should be obtained, and occlusion assessed. Cardiac Arrest V-A ECMO 1. If asystole or a non-perfusing arrhythmia occurs during V-A ECMO, the patient may be fully supported with ECMO. 2. Rule-out ECMO as source of arrest by completely evaluating all components and functions of the ECMO circuit including sweep gas connection, pump failure, occlusion, and servo regulation. 3. STAT page physician to beside. 4. Increase ECMO flow and infuse volume as needed. 5. Provide full resuscitation if ECMO cannot support blood pressure adequately. V-V ECMO 1. If asystole or a non-perfusing arrhythmia occurs during V-V ECMO, the ECMO circuit cannot be used to support the patient.

While respecting an employee's individuality, the Hospital expects personal cleanliness, neat grooming, and clothing that does not interfere with the individual employee's ability to perform his/her job. • Radiology personnel are expected to follow the Ambulatory Services Personal Appearance policy as a baseline of minimum appearance standards in the Ambulatory setting. • Clinical care providers should reference the Nursing Administrative Policy: Professional Attire and Appearance and the hospital's Personal Protective Equipment Policy . • Individuals who work with hazardous materials should reference the Chemical Hygiene Plan Standard Operating Procedures (Proper Attire section). Direct questions about these policies to your supervisor or manager.","Policy and Procedure: A document developed by the hospital, department, or service that describes the expected organizational intent to meet requirements, usually in the form of a statement. Policies contain information available to employees because of the significance of the information, or because the information conveyed is required by regulatory bodies. Policies are intended to be overarching rules that provide the frame within which the organization conducts business. The procedure section includes the specific methods employed to implement the policy. The following are qualifiers to further define policies: 1. High-level, embracing the mission, core values, and goals to be followed 2. Establish a standard practice (e.g., administrative practice; operational criteria; industry practices; standards of care; efficient use of system resources) that is expected to be followed 3. Establish the scope for decision-making and action 4. Refer to associated references (e.g., protocols, procedures, other documents) that serve to facilitate policy compliance; 5. May be required by federal, state, accreditation, or research authorities 6. The procedure section sets forth a specified way to carry out a process/steps that is expected to be followed in order to achieve a policy requirement or intended result. 7. Procedures may not be kept separately from the policy or protocol, i.e. procedures should either appear or be referenced in the policy or protocol. 8. Implementation of a policy or policy change requires an education and communication plan 9. Should not often need to change 10. May be audited Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): A document specifying the procedural steps for a required process or task. Similar to Policies and Procedures, SOPs establish a standard process that is expected to be followed. Clinical Protocols: An independent document from policies, a written plan that specifies pre-defined interventions that are expected to be followed in defined situations and represent a standard of care. Guidelines: A recommended set of measures or actions that the hospital or departments may want to develop and assist staff to achieve a desired outcome. Example of a Clinical Guideline: A standard of care that is followed when reasonably possible, allowing clinical judgment to provide individualized care. Example of an Operational Guideline: A process that is followed when reasonably possible, allowing critical thinking to complete a transaction with HR. Other: Reference Tools as well as Informational and/or Educational Documents that the hospital or departments may want to develop to further assist staff on a specific topic. Internal Confidential Documents : Documents that are highly confidential that are not generally available to the public.","1. The Health Care Proxy form is a simple legal document created to allow a patient to name a person to make health care decisions on their behalf if, for any reason and at any time, the patient becomes unable to make or communicate those decisions or wishes on their own. An otherwise competent adult patient may also ask their health care agent to make decisions on the patient's behalf if the patient feels emotionally unable or unwilling to participate in their own medical care. 2. Prior to any encounter requiring sedation, anesthesia, or anticipated change in mental status and all inpatient admissions, Boston Children's Hospital will inform each competent patient who is at least 18 years of age of his or her right to appoint a Health Care Agent (Proxy). 3. The hospital may not alter the plan of care if the patient chooses to designate a Health Care Agent. The hospital may not prohibit the patient from designating a Health Care Agent. 4. In the event of the patient's inability to make or communicate decisions, the hospital should communicate with the Health Care Agent will use substituted judgment to make decisions about the patient's care. It is expected that the Agent's decisions should be consistent with the Agent's understanding of the patient's beliefs and values around life and/or end-of-life, and health care preferences. 5. To complete the Health Care Proxy paperwork, the form is filled out by the patient (or their designee if the patient is unable to write), and two adults must witness as the patient signs. witnesses cannot be related to you by blood or marriage, cannot be someone who has or may have any claim on your estate, and cannot be entitled to any portion of your estate by any Will or by operation of law. If the patient cannot sign but is competent, page the BCH Attorney on Call to discuss how to document the patient's signature. 6. File the completed Health Care Proxy form in the patient's medical record. Health Care Proxy forms created electronically may be printed and placed in the medical record. 7. Provide the patient a copy of Health Care Proxy documentation upon request. 8. Mature Minor - There are two ways that a minor may be deemed competent to be able to sign a health care proxy to delegate an agent to make healthcare decisions. a. Emancipated Minor : a child who obtained a court order to end the rights and responsibilities of the parent and can make their own decisions. b. Mature Minor : who under common law rules has a specific situation that allows them to consent to their own health care without parental involvement. The specific situations incudes minors who are: married, widowed, or divorced; pregnant; parent of a child; enlisted in the military; or who reasonably believes they have contracted a disease dangerous to the public health. Note: For specific questions on other scenarios and the ability for a minor to sign a Health Care Proxy, please page the BCH Attorney on Call. Inpatient Setting 9. During an inpatient encounter, offer all competent patients 18 years of age or older the opportunity to complete a Health Care Proxy. 10. If the patient declines to complete a Health Care Proxy, document this fact in the Nursing admission assessment (see documentation section of this policy). 11. Clinicians should be aware of their professional obligation to honor a properly executed Health Care Proxy. Health care providers should comply with decisions made by the Agent of the incapacitated patient or under circumstances where the patient wishes to delegate their decision making authority, as long as such decisions are believed to be made in the best interests of the patient and do not appear to exceed the Agent's decision making authority. Any questions or concerns about the implementation of the Health Care Proxy should be referred to the BCH Attorney on Call. Ambulatory Settings 12. During an ambulatory encounter, a clinician or clinical support staff member should provide information about appointing a Health Care Proxy. If a patient has a Health Care Proxy form on file, but indicates that it does not reflect his/her current wishes, a new Health Care Proxy form should be completed and placed in the patient's medical record. A new and properly executed Health Care Proxy form will always void all previous Health Care Proxy forms on file. 13. A patient may revoke a Health Care Proxy by notifying the Agent or health care provider (through verbal, writing, or other actions that indicate the patient's intent). a. To void a HCP form on file in the medical record: i. Print HCP form, write ""Voided at request of the [patient name] on [date]/[time]. [Provider signature]"" scan it into the medical record. Implementation 14. Health Care Proxies are activated if the patient is determined to be unable, unwilling, or does not wish to make decisions on his/her own. 15. If a patient becomes unable to make decisions on his/her own, the attending physician documents the change in the medical record as a progress note, and the authority of a Health Care Agent becomes effective. a. The written determination contains the attending physician's opinion about the cause and nature of the patient's incapacity or wishes as well as its extent and probable duration. 16. If the patient regains decisional capacity, the physician should document the change in mental status. When the patient regains capacity, the authority of the Agent ceases and the authority to make decisions returns to the patient. Access to Information i. Once the Proxy is invoked, the Agent or Proxy has the right to receive any and all medical information necessary to make informed decisions regarding the patient's care. This does not give the Agent authority to receive medical information that is not relevant to making decisions about the current and future care of the patient.",4,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
What guidelines must be followed when reporting adverse events externally,0,Adverse events will be reported to the appropriate agencies within the mandated time frames. 1. External Reporting by PTC a. Transplant-related adverse events designated as required for reporting will be reported to the OPTN b. Donor-derived recipient infections will be reported to the OPO 2. External Reporting by PPSQ (BCH) for serious adverse events in transplant patients a. Serious adverse events designated as required for external reporting will be reported to the appropriate agencies b. Serious adverse events caused by or possibly causing transmission of infectious disease will be reported to the CDC c. Serious adverse events involving a drug or medical device will be reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),"Following the identification of an adverse event, the first priority is the mitigation of harm to the patient and appropriate communication with the family. The responsibility for investigating and responding to events resides with PPSQ, but may be delegated to the individual or department reporting the event for events of lower severity and that are not externally reportable. In all cases, the response to an event is dependent upon the nature and severity of the event. Responses to an adverse event may include, but are not limited to: • Activation of the Safety Event Rapid Response Team (SERRT) • Investigation: Initiation of an investigation and causal analysis of events is undertaken by PPSQ staff and/ or local leaders, depending on the nature and severity of the event. The approach seeks to identify system failures that contributed to the adverse event. Techniques employed may include: ◦ Root Cause Analysis (RCA) ◦ Apparent Cause Analysis (ACA) ◦ Clinical practice concerns of an individual clinician (MD or RN) may be referred to the Medical Peer Review or Nursing Peer Review process. Issues identified related to individual trainees will be referred to the appropriate training program director. ◦ When appropriate, relevant patient outcomes and adverse events may also be reviewed at Divisional or Departmental Morbidity and Mortality (M&M) conferences, consistent with the M&M Policy. ADEs are presented and summarized monthly to the Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T) Committee for review and recommendations for action if needed.","[URAC P-PSC 1-3 (a)] It is Boston Children’s Hospital policy to treat suspected or potential adverse reactions as adverse reactions, therefore the same procedure would be followed for both. A. A standardized reporting mechanism will be employed: 1. All ADEs will be referred to the Specialty Pharmacy Manager for appropriate follow-up; 2. Adverse event reporting will be documented through the hospital’s internal web-based Safety Event Report System (SERS) within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. a. Any hospital employee, volunteer, Medical Staff member, or House Staff member may report an adverse event. b. If staff are uncertain whether an event is a reportable adverse event staff should err on the side of reporting. 3. All clinically significant ADEs will be communicated to the prescribing physician (or attending physician if the prescriber is not available) immediately as well as submit a SERS within 24 hours of becoming aware of the adverse drug event; 4. If the ADE is an ADR, new information (i.e., a new allergy or adverse reaction) must be immediately documented as a coded medication in the patient’s medical record in the allergy/adverse reaction section. B. Criteria for reporting an event through SERS: 1. Events to be submitted through SERS include: a. Any occurrence of an adverse event, any near miss, an event, or situation that places at patient at increased risk of harm, or unplanned significant change in medical or surgical management not related to the patient’s underlying condition b. While the adverse event (and clinically relevant patient information resulting from the event) is documented in the patient’s medical record, the SERS report is maintained separate from the medical report for review purposes. c. Staff should report any unsafe conditions for patients or staff through SERS. C. Completed forms will be routed according to policy and procedure: 1. The Pharmacy Director of Safety & Quality & the Specialty Pharmacy Manager will be notified within 24 hours. D. The responsibility for investigating and responding to events resides with PPSQ (Program for Pharmacy Safety and Quality) but may be delegated to the individual or department reporting the event for events of lower severity and that are not externally reportable. In all cases, the response to an event is dependent upon the nature and severity of the event. E. ADEs are presented and summarized monthly to the Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T) Committee for review and recommendations for action needed. F. The Pharmacy Director of Safety and Quality and the Specialty Pharmacy Manager shall meet quarterly to discuss any ADEs during the quarter or the discussion will take place during quarterly QMC meetings. A detailed analysis shall be compiled which may include a plan of correction and a process for quality improvement. G. On at least a quarterly basis, report aggregate findings, including adverse drug events and errors, to the Quality Management Committee or other quality oversight body responsible for quality management. H. The pharmacy will contact prescribers to inform them of serious (SERS level 3-5) adverse events reported by patients or caregivers. I. Boston Children’s Specialty Pharmacy will report serious and unexpected adverse drug events to appropriate external entities such as Med-Watch and to the drug manufacturer (if contractually obligated). [URAC P-PSC 1-3 (a)] Adverse events are reported externally in accordance with applicable state and federal laws and regulations, and hospital policy. J. All follow-up activities and reports shall be monitored by the Pharmacy Director of Safety and Quality and the Specialty Pharmacy Manager for a period of one (1) year following initiation of the plan of correction.","[URAC P-PSC 1-3 (a)] A. The goals of this policy are: 1. To have a positive impact in improving patient care; 2. To focus attention on understanding the causes that underlie the event; 3. To reduce the probability of a reoccurrence of the event in the future; and 4. To increase the general awareness and enhance strategies for prevention. B. When an adverse event occurs in a health care organization, it is necessary that the appropriate individuals in leadership positions within the organization be made aware of the event; investigate and understand the causes that underlie the event; and make changes in the organization's systems and processes to reduce the probability of such an event in the future. These leaders are responsible for establishing processes for the identification, reporting, analysis, and prevention of adverse events and for ensuring the consistent and ongoing implementation of a root cause analysis. C. Adverse Events that are subject to review by advisory boards and accrediting bodies include: 1. An occurrence or event which results in an unanticipated death; or 2. An event in which major and permanent loss of function (not related to the natural course of the patient's illness or condition) occurs. D. When such an event occurs the Specialty Pharmacy Manager, or their designee, is expected to prepare a thorough and credible root cause analysis and action plan within forty-five (45) calendar days of the event or of becoming aware of the event. The organization may submit the written analysis and plan to its accrediting body at its discretion and as advised by their legal counsel. E. The responsibility for investigating and responding to events resides with Program for Patient Safety and Quality (PPSQ), but may be delegated to the individual or department reporting the event for events of lower severity and that are not externally reportable. In all cases, the response to an event is dependent upon the nature and severity of the event F. Responses to an adverse event may include, but are not limited to: 1. Activation of the Safety Event Rapid Response Team (SERRT) 2. Investigation: Initiation of an investigation and causal analysis of events is undertaken by PPSQ staff and/or local leaders, depending on the nature and severity of the event. The approach seeks to identify system failures that contributed to the adverse event. Techniques employed may include: a. Root Cause Analysis (ACA) i. The RCA (including internal discussions, analysis, and corrective actions related to clinicians) is considered peer review protected information that is approved by the Senior Clinical Leadership Committee (SCLC). b. Apparent Cause Analysis (RCA) i. E.g. Precursor or Near-Miss events c. Clinical practice concerns of an individual clinician (MD or RN) may be referred to the Medical Peer Review or Nursing Peer Review process. Issues identified related to individual trainees will be referred to the appropriate training program director. d. When appropriate, relevant patient outcomes and adverse events may also be reviewed at Divisional or Departmental Morbidity and Mortality (M&M) conferences, consistent with the M&M Policy. G. If applicable, the Specialty Pharmacy Manager will conduct a root cause analysis which includes the following elements: 1. Focuses primarily on systems and processes, not on individual performance; 2. Progresses from special causes in clinical processes to common causes in organizational processes; 3. Repeatedly digs deeper by asking ""why?"" and then ""why?"" again; 4. Identifies changes which could be made in systems and processes that would reduce the risk of such events occurring in the future; and 5. Is thorough and credible. H. Boston Children’s Specialty Pharmacy, as it provides patient/consumer care in the delivery of medications, utilizes the FDA Med-Watch criteria in establishing its definition and reporting requirement of adverse events. [URAC P-PSC 1-3 (a)] 1. The following are reportable adverse events: a. Death - when a medication causes death or contributed to the death of a patient; b. Life-threatening - when a medication may have resulted in the death of a patient if use of the medication had continued; c. Hospitalization - when the medication caused or contributed to the hospitalization of a patient; d. Disability - when a medication may have caused or contributed to a permanent injury or impairment of the patient; e. Intervention - if medical or surgical intervention was necessary to preclude permanent damage due to the use of the medication. I. Adverse events will be reported to a supervisor or other clinical/administrative leader(s) as well as the hospital’s internal web-based Safety Event Reporting System (SERS) within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. The Specialty Pharmacy Manager will be notified when a reportable adverse event occurs, and appropriate action will be taken. The first priority is mitigation of harm to the patient and the appropriate communication with the family. All adverse events will be reported to the Quality Management Committee for review and analysis.",RCA convening is a process for systematic review of events meeting criteria for external reporting as an SRE to the Department of Public Health or other serious adverse events with enterprise applicability. It is used to ensure all causal factors are identified and a root cause is determined. Corrective Actions that address the root cause are developed. This process supports systematic hospital review of patient safety events that result in harm with the goal of preventing similar events.,4,4,0,3,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1
What does NPO stand for and what does it mean in the context of patient care,0,"NPO status prior to moderate or deep sedation is the same as that for patients undergoing general anesthesia. See the NPO Guidelines for Clinicians for more information. • In emergency situations, the appropriate NPO status may be determined by the attending physician in consideration of patient acuity and the urgency of the proposed procedure. • As minimal sedation does not impair a patient's ability to protect their airway, the need for NPO may be determined by individual units and providers.","1.

It may be that one dose of a medication with a long enough duration of action is given and no additional doses are needed during a clinical procedure. However, often many small doses of sedatives/analgesics are used during the time needed to care for the patient. Sedation is performed all over the hospital by many different ""providers"" and the children sedated are monitored less stringently that those receiving anesthesia. For this reason, if the research procedures can be accomplished without administration of any additional sedation medication other than what was planned for the procedure, then the risk category of extending the time to perform procedures during sedation can be considered minimal, if: 1. The patient is stable and 2. Appropriate monitoring continues As mentioned above, the risks of the procedure to be performed should be considered separately and taken into consideration in the overall risk/benefit assessment. If the extension of sedation/procedural or sedation/analgesia does not meet the criteria listed above, it may or may not be considered minimal risk and should be reviewed carefully for final determination in accordance with the federal regulations.","• General guidelines for caring for patients with ASD include: ◦ Be proactive in establishing care ◦ Utilize parents as experts of their child's behavior ◦ Remember that the diagnosis of ASD does not always correlate with behavioral issues ◦ Utilize a team approach in care planning through consultation with Child Life (CL) and the Behavioral Response Team (BRT) ◦ Utilize CL/BRT screening questions prior to arrival at the hospital as a basis for care planning ◦ If appropriate, utilize social stories to help patients ""practice"" potentially challenging hospial situations in advance. Social stories specific to Boston Children's Hospital are accessible via the External Web. ▪ To access: go to the External Web → Centers and Services → Autism Spectrum Center → Resources → My Hospital Stay. There are social stories with pictures for a pre-op visit, labs draws, overnight stays, etc.. Please consult CL for additional resources. ◦ Patients with ASD are often concrete, visual learners. When giving directions, use ""First/Then"" language. ◦ Utilize coping/distraction items (e.g. iPad, chewy toys) whenever available • During chart review, identify patient with ASD and note the following: ◦ Has the patient had a BRT evaluation in the past? If so, is there a current (<1 year old) BRT Behavior Plan in place? ◦ Has the patient been evaluated by Psych for comorbidities? ◦ Has the patient tolerated prior hospitalizations and/or surgical procedures? Was anything particularly challenging? Were any strategies/interventions particularly helpful? • Contact the parent/guardian/caregiver to obtain additional information. Use the following screening questions from CL/BRT as a guide: ◦ How does the patient communicate? ◦ Does the patient have sensory sensitivity to touch, noise, light, too many people, etc.? If so, what helps? ◦ How does the patient react to pain? ◦ What situations trigger/upset the patient? ◦ How does the patient react when upset or agitated? (e.g. kicking, yelling, throwing things, biting, withdrawal, self harm) ◦ How do you calm the patient? (e.g. explanation/information, distraction, quiet space, music, iPad) ◦ Does the patient have an awareness of safety or a history of bolting/fleeing in an attempt to cope? ◦ How does the patient cope with transitions and schedule changes? ◦ What have prior hospitalizations been like for the patient? ◦ Is there anything else we need to know to care for the patient? ◦ Is the parent/caregiver interested in a BRT consult at the pre-op visit? ▪ No: Document if the parent/caregiver denies behavior issues and/or declines a BRT consult. ▪ Yes: Email BRT-DL and the Perioperative Care Coordination Clinic (PCCC) Child Life Specialist (CLS). Document on the PAEF if BRT plans to meet with the family in the PCCC (include pager #) or call the family at home. ◦ If applicable, is the current BRT Behavior Plan still accurate? • Include anesthesiologist Dr. Bistra Vlassakova on emails regarding patients with Behavior Plans • For all patients with ASD and/or documented behavioral issues, notify the PCCC CLS. The CLS will flag the sign-in sheet in the PCCC, notify the Administrative Assistant (AA) staff that the visit should be expedited, and alert the Clinical Assistant staff to potential behavioral challenges when obtaining vital signs, labs, etc.. • Note on the patient's paper chart if a private room is needed upon arrival in the PCCC and/or Pre-Op Holding • Notify CL in advance if pre-op labs are needed • Utilize CL for distraction as needed • Document presence of a BRT plan and other considerations (e.g. private room if patient may be disruptive to others, etc.) on the PAEF Special Needs List • Notify AA staff if Behavioral Precautions are indicated • BRT consult not indicated for patients with high functioning autism who are well-managed • See algorithm below for visual representation:","Boston Children's Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB) may determine that research is minimal risk if the skin biopsy guidance have been followed accordingly. • Skin biopsies may be approved under the category of minimal risk in accordance of the following procedures. • If a protocol d oes not meet criteria, it does not mean the protocol will be disapproved.

What should a nurse do if a minor refuses consent for a potentially lifesaving treatment and negotiation for consent is unsuccessful,0,"• Minor Refuses ◦ If the parent or guardian consents to a medical procedure or treatment, but the minor is resistant or objecting, consider consultation with relevant specialty practices and social work for development of a course of treatment that all parties can agree. ◦ If the minor's life or health is at imminent and serious risk of harm (emergency medical condition), the parent's or guardian's consent is sufficient to proceed with the procedure, intervention, or treatment. ◦ Please note that if the minor is emancipated or a mature minor, the provider must treat the minor as an adult and abide by their request regarding the procedure or treatment. The provider should include social work and other relevant specialties to determine if a course of treatment can be developed that all parties can agree. However, a minor (regardless of emancipation or mature minor status) is generally not free to refuse consent for lifesaving or potentially lifesaving treatment. If consent to treatment cannot be negotiated, the BCH Attorney on Call should be consulted as it may be necessary to obtain legal authorization to treat, withhold, or discontinue treatment. • Parent or Guardian Refuses ◦ If the parent or guardian refuses to consent to a procedure or treatment to which the minor consents, the provider should make sure that the parents have been fully informed and understands the probable consequences of refusal to consent, which should be summarized and entered into the medical record. Consult the BCH against medical advice policy as applicable. ◦ If the primary provider has determined that the minor's life or health is at imminent and serious risk of harm (an emergency condition that needs immediate care/treatment), the provider should perform the necessary procedure, intervention, or treatment. The provider should also consider consulting with applicable BCH staff as appropriate, such as but not limited to the Child Protection Program to determine the necessity of engaging appropriate state agencies. • Adult Patient Refusal to Consent ◦ Mentally competent adult patients (over 18 years of age) generally have a right to refuse treatment, even if it may be lifesaving. Refusing treatment does not, by itself, mean the person is incompetent. In such circumstances, make sure that the patient has been fully informed and understands the probable consequences of his or her refusal. The primary provider should enter into the medical record a summary of the information given to the patient as well as indication that the patient and/or their parents/guardian understood and refused treatment. Mature minors may also have the right to refuse certain procedures. If legal competence is unclear or a patient may be psychiatrically committable (e.g., mentally ill and dangerous to self or others), consult Psychiatry.","• There is a Massachusetts emergency exception to obtaining an informed consent prior to a procedure, intervention, or treatment if the treating provider believes that the procedure, intervention, or treatment is medically necessary to preserve the life of the patient or to prevent the serious impairment of the patient's health. The two key factors for this exception are: ◦ The harm from failure to treat outweighs the harm of the proposed treatment; AND ◦ It is impossible or impractical to obtain consent from the patient and/or a parent/guardian prior to the procedure, intervention, or treatment. • For emergency procedures that are conducted without a prior consent, the provider should document the following in the patient's medical record after the procedure: ◦ An overview of the emergency condition or trauma; ◦ If applicable, the patient's lack of capacity to be aware and discuss the emergency; ◦ The risks of not providing treatment; ◦ The anticipated benefits of providing treatment; ◦ The fact that delay from locating a decision-maker during the emergency situation will result in deterioration of the patient's health, and/or that the patient will suffer prolonged distress from pain; and ◦ The efforts that have been/are being made to either locate or update the parent, guardian, or other family member of the emergency. • If the patient is sedated, unconscious, or under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and consent for a procedure is needed, the provider should consider the following: ◦ If the patient is a minor or has a guardian and there is no immediate medical necessity for medical attention, the provider should treat and stabilize the emergency medical condition, while attempting to contact a parent/guardian for follow up care and treatment; ◦ If the patient is an adult, the provider should also treat and stabilize the emergency medical condition, while also determining if the patient has a Health Care Proxy. If not, go through the elements of the informed consent process with the patient's known caregiver or next of kin, if available. Do not have the caregiver or next of kin sign the informed consent because they do not have the legal authority to sign it, and having them sign it fosters confusion around their actual authority to make decisions on behalf of the patient. Suggested documentation for this scenario may include: ▪ ""Patient unavailable to give informed consent due to [sedation/lack of consciousness]. No other legal decision maker available. [NAME OF PROCEDURE] to be done in patient's best interests. Next of kin/caregiver (LIST out Next of individual) informed."" ◦ If a patient needs to be transported to or from BCH without consent (from the patient and/or the parent/guardian), this should only occur if there is a documented emergency condition or medical necessity for a transport for an immediate procedure, intervention, or treatment.

What is the process for submitting revised consents and recruitment notices for review in the CHeRP system,0,All revisions/amendments that do not meet the criteria for expedited review are placed on the agenda for the convened IRB meeting. All members are provided with a copy of the amendment/revision request form with the proposed changes listed along with the rationale for the change. 1. Each amendment is assigned a primary and a secondary reviewer. a. Reviewers get a Reviewer Worksheet that needs to be completed and submitted at the end of the meeting. 2. The CHeRP system allows members to review side-by-side the sections of the SmartForm and attached materials that have been changed. a. Revised consents and recruitment notices are submitted in tracked changes to improve efficiency and effectiveness of the review process. 3. The voting procedures listed above apply to the review and voting process for amendments/revisions.,"Administrative Update Applicability Research approved after January 21, 2019 and Non-FDA regulated research Research approved through expedited review after January 21, 2019 does not require continuing review but will undergo an administrative update unless: 1. The IRB reviewer has requested continuing review by providing and documenting a rationale for their decision on the reviewer worksheet or 2. The research is FDA regulated Investigators will be required to complete an administrative update in order to assure continued and ongoing oversight pertaining to other elements of the human research protection program at Boston Children's Hospital. Research approved prior to January 21, 2019 and is not FDA regulated may transition to an administrative update process if at the time of continuing review, the research has progressed to the point that it only involves one or both of the following, which are included as part of the IRB- approved study: 1. Data analysis, including analysis of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens or 2. Accessing follow-up clinical data from procedures that subjects would undergo as part of clinical care In these cases, all informed consents will have been deactivated and there would be no additional requirements to transition the protocol to the Revised Common Rule. Studies subject to administrative updates are approved for a period of no longer than 1 year and may not continue after expiration without undergoing subsequent administrative update review. Administrative Update Review Process The IRB administrative office is responsible for tracking administrative updates and for notifying investigators when review is required. The Administrative Update Review SmartForm must be submitted and approved on an annual basis with expiration dates established on the same basis as continuing reviews. The CHeRP system will send notice to the PI and the research team: 1. Three months before the protocol's expiration, the CHeRP system will send an automated notice to the PI and research team. 2. If the Administrative Update is not received, then, a. A second notice will be sent at 2 months before the expiration date. b. A third notice will be sent 1 month before the expiration date. If the administrative update form is not approved before the expiration date, the protocol will expire.","Continuing reviews that meet the regulatory criteria for expedited review are not placed on the agenda for full IRB review. 1. Each continuing review is assigned a primary reviewer. a. A Reviewer Worksheet is provided and needs to be completed and submitted at the end of the meeting. The worksheet is structured so that the reviewer can determine whether the regulatory criteria continue to be met. 2. Through the CHeRP system, the primary reviewer is provided with a copy of the continuing review SmartForm. They also have access to the entire protocol, and associated materials, including study history (i.e. previous continuing reviews and Reportable Events). 3. The procedures listed above apply to the review and voting process for continuing reviews. 4. The IRB determines the time frame for the subsequent continuing review. a. The continuing review time period must be set to occur within 1 year of the approval date. b. The default is one year, unless the IRB votes otherwise. Protocols that require continuing review in accordance with the Revised Common Rule, effective January 19, 2019 and the protocols approved prior to that date are referenced in the IRB policy: Continuing Review and Administrative Updates.","A proposed change in research related activities may be approved through expedited review procedures if: 1. it does not: a. materially affect an assessment of the risks and benefits of the study and b. does not substantially change the specific aims or design of the study may be approved through expedited review procedures. 2. it includes changes minor changes to previously approved research. Expedited review will be performed by the IRB Chair, Vice Chair, or designated experienced IRB member. 1. The expedited reviewer who is performing the expedited review has electronic access via CHeRP to the amendment request which specifies the requested changes and any revised documents. 2. The expedited reviewer may ask for further justification from the Principal Investigator (PI) for the requested amendment. a. If there are questions or concerns that the PI needs to address, the IRB administrator will communicate these concerns to the PI. 3. If there are no issues for the PI to address, the amendment can be approved. As part of the expedited review, the reviewer will determine whether the amendment qualifies as: 1. A minor modification or 2. An amendment that qualifies for expedited review and if subjects who have previously enrolled in the research should be provided with information about the amendment. This occurs when such information may impact a subject's willingness to participate in the research. The expedited reviewer will also determine whether they wish to see the investigator's revisions or if the IRB administrators may verify that the changes have been made. Amendments that are approved through expedited review are summarized and provided to the convened IRB on a monthly basis. Minor Modifications Examples Examples of minor modifications may include: 1. Changes in the research staff/personnel for a protocol 2. Non-substantive revisions in the informed consent document 3. Revisions or modifications in the informed consent to provide better clarification 4. Changes to improve the clarity of statements or to correct typographical errors, provided that such changes do not alter the content or intent of a statement 5. The substitution of assessments with alternate assessments that present minimal risk 6. An increase or decrease in proposed human research subject enrollment supported by a statistical justification 7. Narrowing the range of inclusion criteria 8. Broadening the range of exclusion criteria only if the risk/benefit assessment remains unchanged 9. Decreasing the number or volume of biological sample collections, provided that such a change does not affect the collection of information related to safety evaluations 10. An increase in the length of confinement or number of study visits for the purpose of increased safety monitoring, provided the risk/benefit ratio does not change. 11. A decrease in the length of confinement or number of study visits, provided that such a decrease does not affect the collection of data related to safety evaluations 12. Alterations in human research subject payment that do not add any element of undue influence 13. Addition of recruitment notices, recruitment sites, or a population, provided there is no change in the risk/ benefit determination","Medical Record Screening Investigators who wish to query medical records in order to find potentially eligible subjects for recruitment are required to justify a waiver of HIPAA Authorization to review records for recuitment purposes. The protocol application includes specific questions in order to justify a waiver for the review of records. Introductory Material Providing Written Information Prior to Approaching a Potential Subject Providing materials prior to being approached enables families to give informed consideration to participating in the study and allow them to be better prepared to ask questions when they are approached directly. Whenever possible, the IRB recommends that potential subjects receive written information about a study prior to being approached in person. This is not always possible, as it may not be practical for some protocols. Some examples include: a letter sent to a potential subject's home or thorugh approved electronic means approved by the IRB , a pamphlet, or an information sheet that is presented to a potential subject at the start of a visit. Criteria: Care Provider or Chair/Chief of a Department Signature In general and whenever reasonably possible, after potential subjects have left Boston Children's Hospital, the IRB requires that initial recruitment materials (e.g. letters, surveys, information sheets, etc.) to potential research subjects be signed/co-signed by a care provider known to the family or the Chair/Chief of a department with which the family is familiar. If an investigator feels they cannot follow this guideline, they will need to provide a justification in detail within their protocol on why this is not possible. Recommended Elements: 1. How the potential subject's name was obtained. For example, it should be indicated how and from where the list of names of potential subjects was generated. 2. What information the investigator has obtained about the patient. 3. When applicable, the fact that the medical record was not reviewed and what was not accessed. 4. An acknowlegement of the family's status to discern if it is an appropriate time to recruit (e.g. death of child, stressful time, etc.). Telephone Recruitment and Communication Telephone recruitment can be acceptable. In most cases, the IRB will require introductory recruitment materials (see section: Introductory Material); however, there are limited situations when an initial call is acceptable. Initial Phone Contact Requirements It is important that subjects are aware that the call is a legitimate call from Boston Children's Hospital. 1. The IRB requires that any initial phone contact for recruitment purposes be made on a Boston Children's Hospital telephone. 2. The telephone must indicate that it is a Boston Children's Hospital on the caller ID. Established Relationship and Personal Phone Use Once initial contact is made and the research team has established a relationship with the potential subject, it is acceptable to use other personal phones with the understanding of the following recommendations: 1. It is highly recommended that when using a personal phone, the *67 feature be utilized when placing the call to prevent the actual cell phone number from being displayed. 2. In situations where there is concern that recipient phones will block all non-identified calls or the researcher wants the number to be displayed, subjects should be advised during the initial contact as to: a. How they will be contacted and b. By whom so they will recognize the calls. 3. It is important to remember to only use cell phones where appropriate confidentiality can be maintained. Calls should not be made in public locations where privacy cannot be maintained. Directed Advertisement Placement Advertisements that are to appear on television or other predominately public locations may be subject to review by the Public Affairs Office. Online Internet and Social Media: * Internet and social media recruitment is subject to the same regulatory and ethical norms as traditional recruitment, including the requirements of prospective review and approval by an IRB compliance with all applicable federal and state laws, fair and equitable subject selection, respect for the privacy and other interests of potential participants, sensitivity to the norms and values of different communities, and consideration for the impacts of different recruitment techniques on public trust in the research enterprise. Investigators proposing internet social media recruitment should approach it in substantially the same way they do traditional recruitment methods. Investigators should: 1. Ensure that social media recruitment methods comply with all pertinent laws and federal regulations, including HIPAA and HITECH. 2. Ensure that proposed social media recruitment techniques comply with the policies and terms of use of the relevant websites 3. Ensure that the proposed recruitment strategy: a. Is sensitive to the privacy of potential participants; b. Is respectful of the norms of the community being recruited; and c. Will not undermine public trust in the research enterprise, including via deceptive practices or lack of transparency. The Boston Children's Hospital IRB will work closely with the Hospital's Social Media department to assure that all institutional policies are followed. Investigators may be instructed to contact the social media department as part of the IRB review and approval process *Sourced from Harvard Catalyst: The Use of Social Media in Recruitment to Research: A Guide for Investigators and IRBs Clinical Trial Listings Websites IRB review and approval of clinical trial listings on the internet are not required when the system format limits the information provided to basic trial information such as: the title, purpose of the study, protocol summary, basic eligibility criteria, study site location(s), and how to contact the site for further information. Examples of clinical trial listing services that do not require IRB approval include the following: 1. National Cancer Institute's Cancer Clinical Trial Listing (PDQ), 2. Clinicaltrials.gov 3. Government-sponsored AIDS Clinical Trials Information Service (ACTIS). However, when the opportunity to add additional descriptive information is allowed by the database system, IRB review and approval are required. Recruitment of Participants at External non-Boston Children's Hospital Institutions Requests to post a notice on a bulletin board, leave pamphlets in a clinic/procedure/inpatient waiting area, or have individuals distribute information regarding research conducted at an external non-Boston Children's Hospital institution is permitted. In these situations, a parent or child may read the information and decide whether they wish to contact the Boston Children's Hospital investigator. However, it is necessary to assure that all policies regarding this type of recruitment are in accordance with the external institution. In addition, this plan should be disclosed in the protocol application. Recruitment of Participants at Boston Children's Hospital for non-Boston Children's Hospital Research If a Boston Children's Hospital investigator is asked to participate in recruitment activities for a non-Boston Children's Hospital Investigator, that consist of: 1. Identifying eligible subjects 2. Assisting in recruiting procedures by discussing information about a study with a possible participant 3. Assisting in the informed consent process A research protocol from the other institution must be reviewed and approved by the Boston Children's Hospital IRB or arrangements for a reliance agreement must be made. This is necessary because a Boston Children's Hospital investigator is actively performing activities that may be viewed as ""engagement"" in human subject research. It is possible that Boston Children's Hospital will rely on another institution's IRB approval, however the IRB office must be notified to make this decision. If activities are limited to solely distributing information about the research and it is up to the potential subject to contact the external investigator, Boston Children's Hospital IRB approval is not required. For more information, see the IRB Policy: Single IRB Review Follow-up and Participant Opt-Out Follow-up When a potential subject does not respond to the intial recrutiment contact, it is highly recommended that follow-up contact be limited to three attempts. 1. The IRB considers ""contact"" to include voice messages, emails, texts, etc. 2. When describing plans for contacting individuals multiple times in an effort to secure their enrollment into the study, it should be specified how many contact attempts will be made and the mode (e.g. voice messages, emails, texts, etc.). 3. If an investigator feels they cannot follow this guideline, they will need to provide a justification in detail within their protocol on why this is not possible for the intended study. Opt-out Option Potential subjects must be given the option to request no further contact. 1. It is suggested that a method to opt-out (e.g. mailing response card, telephone number, email address, etc.) be included with the recruitment effort for subjects to respond if they do not wish to be contacted further. 2. If a potential subject responds indicating they would like to opts-out, no further contact of that individual is to be attempted.",4,1,4,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
What are the expected patient outcomes that we should monitor after the insertion of a postpyloric feeding tube,0,"• Obtain a Gastroenterology (GI) consult prior to discharge to establish follow-up, and discuss a plan for replacement of tube when needed. • In general, if oral intake is expected to improve over the first year of life (for example, feeding immaturity related to prematurity or aspiration), nasal tubes may be a viable option for discharge to home, after discussion with the family. ◦ Pros: Avoidance of surgery/laparoscopy, temporary nature of the tube ◦ Cons: Tubes prone to dislodgement, need to maintain tube on the face, nasal congestion/obstruction from the tube • Patients are generally discharged with a post-pyloric tube (versus NG) if they improved with inpatient post-pyloric feedings, and/or continue to have severe illness that prompted the original placement of the post-pyloric tube (e.g. respiratory, neuromuscular, or GER), especially if being transferred to a rehabilitation facility (versus home). • Specific considerations for home post-pyloric feeding that should be discussed amongst the medical team, GI consulting service, and family are: ◦ Replacement of dislodged post-pyloric tubes does not occur at home, in a clinic, or in most locals Emergency Departments. The infant would likely need to present to the BCH ED to replace the tube via fluoroscopy. ◦ Post-pyloric feeds run continuously, over a majority of the hours per day, which may complicate activities, especially in the outpatient setting.","• Registered Nurses (RNs) and Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs), who have demonstrated competency in the insertion of post-pyloric feeding tubes, may place these tubes, following the guidelines described in this document. • Recommended sizes: ◦ 6 Fr 22 in non-weighted feeding tube with a stylet for patients ≤ 5kg. ◦ 8 36-43 in Fr non-weighted feeding tube with stylet for patients > 5kg. ◦ Consider use of 10 Fr 43 in feeding tube in patients > 12 years of age. • Obtain a prescriber order for abdominal x-ray (KUB) after feeding tube placement to confirm proper tube position.","This reference tool describes a technique for clearing an obstruction from an enteral feeding tube. • Refer to the Nursing Patient Care Policy and Procedure Manual Gastrointestinal section for additional information about enteral tube management. • Refer to the Enteral Tube Type reference tool for detailed product descriptions. Warm water is the preferred agent for managing enteral tube obstructions. Using a gentle back and forth or pulsing motion with the syringe, push warm water through the tube to break up the obstruction. Carbonated beverages (i.e. cola) or cranberry juice are seldom effective and should not be used. These substances leave a residue on the lining of the enteral tube and pose additional clogging risk. If water fails to clear the obstruction, an enzyme solution should be used. The enzyme solution requires a provider order . It is called ""Gastrostomy Tube Obstruction Plan"". To clear a clogged or blocked enteral feeding tube using an enzyme solution, follow these steps: 1. Crush 1 sodium bicarbonate tablet (325 mg). Mix the powder with the contents of one enzyme capsule (Zenpep 5,000 units) in 10 mL warm water. Mix into a slurry. Allow solution to dissolve completely. 2. Instill the slurry into the obstructed feeding tube using a 10-30mL syringe. Allow 60-minute dwell time to ensure the enzyme solution has maximal contact with the obstruction. 3. Using a syringe, pull back to withdraw the slurry solution from the feeding tube (slurry as well as the obstruction). Avoid using excess force to prevent enteral tube damage. 4. Flush the enteral feeding tube with warm water prior to resuming use. Note: If you are unable to instill warm water or slurry solution due to complete obstruction of enteral feeding tube then follow protocol for replacing the tube.","1. Pre-oxygenate prior to changing the tracheostomy tube, when indicated. 2. Position the patient with the neck in slight extension, using a small roll under the shoulders to provide full access and view of stoma. 3. Release tracheostomy ties and dressing while a second person holds the tracheostomy tube in place, remove the ties from the back of the neck. 4. Deflate cuff, if applicable and remove the tracheostomy tube, following the curve of the tube, briefly visualize the stoma site and note any areas of irregularity. 5. Insert new tracheostomy tube with obturator in place, following the curve of the airway. 6. Hold new tracheostomy tube in place and remove obturator immediately after insertion of the new tracheostomy tube. 7. In the event of respiratory distress, resistance when attempting to insert new tube, or stoma closure when old tube is removed, insertion of the available smaller size should be attempted. The designated provider should be notified immediately. 8. Replace inner cannula and/or inflate cuff to minimal leak technique if indicated. 9. Resume previous level of support and if the patient requires assisted ventilation, confirm correct placement with CO2. et 10. Assess patient's respiratory status, breath sounds, and tube patency. 11. Secure the tracheostomy ties and tracheostomy dressing, if indicated and test for proper tie tightness (one small finger width) while upright or a side lying position. 12. Remove the roll from under the shoulders.","This reference sheet includes enteral feeding tubes and accessories regularly used at Boston Children's Hospital.

All nursing staff participates in quality improvement activities through chart reviews, data collection, data analysis, and discussion of indicators and strategies for improvement. Action plans that address opportunities for improvement, identified through the collective data, are developed at the unit and department level. Improvement is monitored and reported back to the unit. Consideration for relevant measures is reviewed on a regular basis. Examples of quality measures include, but are not limited to, the following: • Medical Record Reviews • Core Metrics • NDNQI • National Patient Safety Goals • Unit and Hospital Performance Improvement Initiatives • Process Measure Analysis • Safety Event Review • Patient Experience Measures In addition to the quality measure examples above, the NICU maintains a constant focus on improving the quality of care through multidisciplinary involvement in the regular monitoring of NICU quality assurance metrics with benchmarking, and participation in national collaborative forums. NICU staff are engaged in the monitoring of quality assurance performance improvement (QAPI) initiatives and the analysis of the data to ensure continuous improvement.","To ensure that care, treatment, and services provided to patients through Clinical Contracts are provided safely and effectively, each Clinical Contract must meet all applicable criteria and be actively monitored, all as set out below. Any department entering into a Clinical Contract will have responsibility for that Clinical Contract and its compliance with this policy. I. Any department entering into a Clinical Contract will: a. Ensure the Clinical Contract clearly describes the nature and scope of services to be provided under the contract. b. Ensure that compensation for services provided under the Clinical Contract will be fair market value for those services, i.e., the price paid will be comparable to that which would typically be paid by unaffiliated third parties for the same services. c. Require legal review by the OGC unless standard contract templates and/or approved language modification attachments are used. d. Require a Business Associate Agreement (“BAA”) for any Clinical Contract that involves the use/disclosure/ access of Protected Health Information (“PHI”) unless the arrangement fits within the treatment exception. BAA template and applicability guidance is available on the Compliance Department website. In non-standard circumstances, the Privacy Officer will determine whether a BAA is required. e. Include Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement (QAPI) language as outlined in Attachment A of this policy. That language is intended to ensure that the third party contractor obligations for quality of service and adherence to quality standards meet BCH expectations and follow BCH policies; federal regulatory requirements under the CMS conditions of participation; and The Joint Commission accreditation standards, as appropriate. f. Obtain approval and signatures for the Clinical Contract in accordance with Boston Children’s Hospital’s Contracting Standard Operating Procedure and shall send a fully executed copy of the Clinical Contract to the Office of General Counsel paralegal to be included in the Clinical Contract repository. g. Assign to the Clinical Contract a Business Manager who shall be accountable to review the contract expectations, establish appropriate quality and operational measures and monitoring frequencies, and to report quality performance through the QAPI reporting pathway established by the department. II. Guidance regarding the Business Manager’s duties is below: a. Expectations: The Business Manager is responsible for providing quality oversight of the Clinical Contract and ensures that the Clinical Contract includes a written description of both performance and quality expectations. The Business Manager collaborates with the third party contractor to monitor the performance and quality metrics and ensure the third party contractor regularly provides such performance and quality information to the Business Manager during the term of the Clinical Contract. b. Quality Measures: The Business Manager develops quality metrics in collaboration with the BCH Program for Patient Safety and Quality (PPSQ Director Quality Management and Performance Improvement). The defined metrics and threshold performance targets are monitored for acceptable performance of the third party contractor under the Clinical Contract. These quality metrics are finalized prior to approval of the Clinical Contract. Examples of metrics may include, but are not limited to: i. Review of the contractor’s Joint Commission accreditation or CMS certification status ii. Direct observation of the provision of care iii. Audit of documentation, including medical records iv. Review of periodic reports submitted by the individual or organization providing services under contractual agreement v. Collection of data that address the efficacy of the contracted service vi. Review of performance reports based on indicators required in the contractual agreement vii. Input from staff and patients viii. Review of patient satisfaction surveys ix. Review of results of risk management activities x. A form of Performance Evaluation Report is attached to this Policy as Attachment B. c. Monitoring: Performance against target thresholds for all metrics are monitored quarterly. d. Reporting: The Business Manager/Quality contact provides Clinical Contract evaluation reports to the department quality and leadership team on a regular basis. These reports are submitted to PPSQ Director of Clinical Regulatory Compliance and Patient Safety on quarterly basis. If there is not a department-based quality improvement consultant or QAPI manager, the Business Manager will report directly to the department’s leadership team and to PPSQ. Periodic reports will be made to either the Senior Clinical Leadership Committee or Executive Management Committee, as appropriate, in order to give clinical leaders and/or executive management an opportunity to ensure that appropriate QAPI measures are being met and to provide input when deviations occur. It is important that there is a robust QAPI process, which ensures bi- directional communication is documented in the appropriate minutes, along with any feedback generated through this review. On at least an annual basis, a report on Clinical Contracts compliance will be provided to the Patient Care Assessment Committee of the Hospital’s Board of Trustees. i. Corrective Action: In the event that contracted services do not meet defined expectations reflected by the established metrics and threshold targets, the Business Manager and his/her supervisor will report such non- compliance to PPSQ Director of Clinical Regulatory Compliance and Patient Safety and will take steps to improve care, treatment, and services, which may include: 1. Increasing monitoring of the contracted services 2. Providing consultation or training to the contractor 3. Renegotiating the terms of the Clinical Contract 4. Terminating the Clinical Contract ii. When Clinical Contracts are renegotiated or terminated, the Business Manager will assure that appropriate planning occurs so that the continuity of care, treatment, and services to patients are not disrupted. III. The Medical Staff Executive Committee and the Medical Staff Services Department ensures that all licensed independent practitioners who are responsible for the patient’s care, treatment, and services via a Clinical Contract are credentialed and privileged to do so prior to commencement of services under the Clinical Contract. IV. The Chief of the Department of Laboratory Medicine requires and ensures that reference and contract laboratory services meet the federal regulations for clinical laboratories and maintain evidence of the same. V. PPSQ maintains a list of Clinical Contracts in a central repository, i.e., contracts that provide for services that support the delivery of patient care and have an impact on patient care. The list of Clinical Contracts and such supporting documentation are provided to CMS, The Joint Commission, and such other agencies as may have jurisdiction, as requested. VI. All Clinical Contracts are reviewed at least every three years and, without a compelling rationale otherwise; no Clinical Contract will exceed a three-year term.","The Pediatric Transplant Center (PTC) has a comprehensive data-driven Quality Assurance Performance Improvement (QAPI) program that monitors and evaluates all solid organ transplant programs at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) by aligning transplant and hospital quality goals and metrics while allowing the PTC to centralize the reporting and evaluation of quality projects and metrics present in individual departments and programs that relate to transplant services. The PTC has a full-time transplant quality improvement consultant and a part-time physician quality leader. The QAPI program is monitored by a committee that endorses and updates the BCH transplant QAPI plan on an annual basis. The QAPI plan serves as a vehicle for accountability and alignment with the PTC and BCH Program for Patient Safety and Quality (PPSQ) with the goal of continuously improving clinical outcomes. The committee is endorsed by the PTC, which reports to the BCH Medical Staff Executive Committee which includes physician chiefs, the Chief Nursing Officer/Senior VP of Clinical Services and President/Chief Operating Officer. The QAPI committee meets five times annually, at a minimum. Documentation of meetings is kept in the PTC shared drive. The QAPI Committee members: • Update the Transplant QAPI plan annually. • Effectively monitor, evaluate and balance the quality and efficiency of patient care, as appropriate. • Make recommendations for the allocation of resources that will most benefit the goals of patient safety and improved clinical outcomes while promoting operational efficiencies. • Review and approve clinical indicators/metrics and clinical practice guidelines, as appropriate and necessary. • Assure transplant medical staff compliance with accreditation/regulatory requirements of external bodies (UNOS, CMS, Joint Commission, DPH, etc.) and the hospital. • Assist with resolution of inter-divisional and interdepartmental conflicts when necessary and achievable. Additionally, each inpatient unit participates in collection of data for nurse-sensitive indicators related to unit and hospital focus that include the following: • Medical Record Reviews • Core Metrics • NDNQI • National Patient Safety Goals • Unit-based monthly audits • Program-based quality measures • Hospital-wide audits (Controlled Substances, NDNQI, Skin Survey, etc.) • Patient and family satisfaction All nursing staff participate in quality improvement activities through chart reviews, data collection, data analysis and/or discussion of indicators and strategies for improvement.

Eye protection when used consistently and appropriately will reduce exposure to pathogens that may be transmitted during patient transports. b. Following Boston MedFlight's policies during rotor wing transports will protect eyes during patient care as well as during any unexpected events that may arise during rotor wing transports. 5. Exposure: a. If exposed to human blood or body fluids page 7845 (STIK) for immediate assistance.","Gloves 1. Gloves are worn for two important reasons in the healthcare environment: a. To protect healthcare workers by providing a barrier to prevent gross contamination of the hands when touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, mucous membranes, nonintact skin and contaminated equipment/devices; b. To protect the patient by reducing the likelihood that microorganisms present on the hands of personnel will be transmitted to patients in the course of their care. Wear clean gloves when: ▪ Touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, nonintact skin, and mucous membranes ▪ Performing invasive procedures, including venipuncture ▪ Touching objects or surfaces contaminated with blood, body fluids, secretions, or excretions Change gloves and treat hands between tasks and procedures on the same patient after contact with material that may contain an increased concentration of organisms (such as stool). Remove gloves promptly after use. Perform hand hygiene immediately after removing gloves to avoid transfer of organisms. Gown 1. Wear a clean, non-sterile yellow precaution gown to protect skin and to prevent soiling of clothing during activities that may generate splashes or sprays of blood or body fluids. Remove the soiled gown promptly after use and perform hand hygiene. Gowns should not be reused. Face Protection 1. Wear a mask in combination with hospital-approved eye protection, or a face shield to protect mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, or mouth during activities that may generate splashes or sprays of blood and or body fluids. Remove soiled face protection promptly after use and wash hands. 2. Personal eyeglasses are not considered to be adequate eye protection unless fitted with side shields and approved by the hospital. Ensure that PPE is adequately positioned and secured to avoid the need to reposition, which can lead to potential self-contamination. Other Protective Apparel 1. Surgical caps or hoods and shoe covers are required when gross contamination of the head and/or feet can be reasonably anticipated, such as in the Operating Room. Emergency Ventilation Devices 1. Use mouthpieces or resuscitation bags as an alternative to mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.","1. Eating or drinking by staff is not allowed in the dialysis unit. Eating, drinking and food storage is allowed in designated non-patient areas only 2.

Crew members transporting patients with Boston MedFlight will follow policies to protect eyes while in rotor and fixed wing aircrafts. • Purpose: To ensure that crew members are not exposed to blood and bodily fluid borne pathogens via splashes to the eyes when providing care to patients during transports. To ensure that crew members' eyes are protected from both splashes and projectiles when transporting patients with Boston MedFlight.,"Engineering controls are defined as controls (e.g., sharps disposal containers, self-sheathing needles, sharps with engineered sharps injury protection and needleless systems) that isolate or remove the blood borne pathogens hazard from the workplace. Universal precautions are an approach to infection control that requires all human blood and certain other human body fluids to be treated as if they were known to be infectious for HIV, Hepatitis B virus and other blood borne pathogens. Universal precautions are a key prevention strategy mandated by OSHA. Standard precautions combine the features of universal precautions and body substance isolation, and are based on the principle that blood, body fluids, secretions, non-intact skin, mucous membranes, and excretions (except sweat), may contain transmissible infectious agents. Standard precautions are to be used on all patients, regardless of their diagnosis or presumed infectious status, when coming into contact (or risk of contact) with any of the following: • Blood • All body fluids • Non-intact skin • Mucous membranes Engineered sharps injury protection is a physical attribute built into a needle device used for withdrawing body fluids, accessing a vein or artery, or administering medications or other fluids, which effectively reduces the risk of an exposure incident by a mechanism such as barrier creation, blunting, encapsulation, withdrawal, or other effective mechanisms. Engineered sharps injury protection is also a physical attribute built into any other type of needle device or into a non-needle sharp, which effectively reduces the risk of an exposure incident. Work practice controls are behaviors or good work habits that will be used to reduce the chance of exposure to blood borne pathogens. Hand hygiene includes both hand washing with either plain or antiseptic-containing soap and water and use of alcohol-based products that do not require the use of water.",4,3,3,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

Capable of delivering a number of therapies including: a. Anti-tachycardia (""overdrive"") pacing b. Single or dual chamber pacing for bradycardia c. Cardioversion d. Defibrillation e. Adaptive rate sensors 2. AICDs are usually implanted subcutaneously in the abdomen or left chest. 3. Malfunction may lead to failure to defibrillate in the presence of an abnormal rhythm, or administration of countershocks when not indicated. 4. Whenever possible, obtain a 12-lead ECG at the referring hospital for review by the cardiology service. DO NOT DELAY transport to obtain a 12-lead ECG; instead, it is acceptable to record tracings from limb leads (I, II, and III). 5. In addition to usual patient history, obtain the following information if able: a. Device capabilities and programmed settings – see Appendix 1: Implantable Pacemaker/ AICD Nomenclature Information Sheet b. Date of last battery change c. History of delivered shocks in recent past d. Name and contact information for patient's EP Cardiologist e. Pertinent history that may be contributory to ICD malfunction (i.e.: hit in the chest area of implant, exposure to power source) 6. For patients with AICD failure and presence of a rhythm for which defibrillation or cardioversion is indicated, perform defibrillation or cardioversion using the energy doses provided above in the Cardioversion and Defibrillation section. Avoid placing the defibrillator paddles/ pads over the AICD device. 7. For patients with AICD malfunction who are receiving defibrillations that are not indicated, consult with the Medical Control Physician. With authorization from the Medical Control Physician, place a magnet over the AICD to disable it. The magnet should be kept in place for the duration of the transport. Be prepared to perform transthoracic defibrillation or cardioversion if indicated. Do not place the defibrillator paddles/ pads over the AICD device. 8. Strong electrical fields may interfere with AICD performance. Precautions to be taken in the transport environment include: a. Cell phones should be kept > 6 inches from patient's implant site. b. Patient should not be subjected to MRI or radiation therapy doses of radiation. Dosing used for plain radiographs is permissible. c. Airport metal detectors may be set off by the device and hand wands may interfere with device performance.

However, due to the inherent risks involved in email use, the following policy considerations must be clearly addressed with the patient prior to using email for provider/patient communications. Before any clinical program can set up email use, it must adopt specific written procedures conforming to these requirements, and ISD and Privacy Officer must approve the procedure. • Patient informed consent and agreement to guidelines for use of email must be documented. Informed consent should address the following: ◦ Email communication is a convenience and not appropriate for emergencies or time-sensitive issues. ◦ No one can guarantee the security and privacy of email messages. ◦ Employers have the right to access any email received or sent by a person at work. ◦ Sensitive or personal information should not be communicated via email. ◦ Communication guidelines should be defined, including, (1) how often email will be checked, (2) instructions for when and how to escalate to phone calls and office visits, and (3) the types of transactions that are appropriate for email. ◦ Staff other than the physician may read and process the email. • Clinically relevant messages and responses will be documented in the medical record. • Boundaries for clinical and operational staff usage of patient electronic mail must be defined. Considerations include: ◦ All users, including physicians, sign a confidentiality and security agreement that addresses electronic technology. ◦ Use of a central address for receipt of all email messages. ◦ Identification of processes to manage triage, routing, response and filing of email messages. ◦ Process to verify that message is from an established patient before responding. ◦ Reasonable precautions to ensure that email responses to patients are not misdirected or otherwise become available to unintended parties. ◦ Use of discreet subject headers such as ""personal and confidential communication."" ◦ Incorporation of all clinically relevant email messages, including the full text of the patient's query as well as the reply to the sender, in the patient's electronic or paper medical record. ◦ Obtaining of patient's express authorization prior to any forwarding of patient identifiable information to a third party such as a consultant or health plan. ◦ Prohibitions on use of the patient's email addresses for marketing or the supplying of addresses to third parties for advertising or any other use. • Technical security practices: ◦ Restriction of access to the professional email account in the same way access to medical records is restricted. ◦ Protection of information considered confidential or sensitive by utilizing encryption or some other system of access controls [approved by the Chief Information Security Officer] that ensures the information is not accessed by anyone other than the intended recipient. ◦ Prohibition of the use of unsecured wireless email communication when sending patient-identifiable information.","A research protocol must specify if the research team intends to follow an individual's preference to communicate via non-secure email or text.

What is the process for handling a case of research misconduct if the respondent provides a signed and legally sufficient admission in writing,0,"If the Respondent provides a signed and legally sufficient admission in writing, a case may be closed. The RIO (jointly with HMS if a joint process) will appoint a person or panel to review the details of the admission. Before settlement with the Respondent can been reached, the RIO will notify the Office of Research Integrity (""ORI"") if the research in question is Public Health Services (""PHS"")-related. With ORI review and concurrence, the RIO will ensure that there are sufficient bases to conclude that the extent of Research Misconduct has been identified. Once ORI approves, the DO will review the appropriateness of institutional actions and sanctions. The RIO will ensure that the administrative actions by BCH and ORI are implemented and notifies other involved parties such as pertinent chief (s) or chair (s).","HHS (45 CFR 46.117(c)) and FDA (21 CFR 56.109(c)(1)) allow the IRB to waive written informed consent for research that meets specific regulatory criteria. 1. For HHS funded research (45 CFR 46.117(c)), the IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds either: a. That the only record linking the subject and the research would be the informed consent form and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. b. Each subject (or legally authorized representative) will be asked whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the research, and the subject's wishes will govern; i. That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context; or ii. If the subjects or legally authorized representatives are members of a distinct cultural group or community in which signing forms is not the norm, that the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and provided there is an appropriate alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained. 2. For FDA regulated research (21 CFR 56.109(c)(1)), the IRB may only waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds: a. That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context. 3. The investigator is required to justify in the protocol how the conditions for waiver of documentation are to be met. 4. The procedure for waiving the requirement for documentation is not intended to circumvent the requirement for informed consent but rather to protect patient privacy. All required information must still be presented and discussed to ensure a voluntary informed consent process. 5. In cases in which the documentation requirement is waived (referred to as ""obtained through a method other than a written document"" in Boston Children's Hospital IRB application and approval materials), the IRB will often require the investigator to provide subjects with written information about the research.","FDA CFR 50.24 The IRB responsible for the review, approval, and continuing review of the clinical investigation described in this section may approve that investigation without requiring that informed consent of all subjects be obtained if the IRB (with the concurrence of a licensed physician who is a member of the IRB and who is not otherwise participating in the clinical investigation, if subject to FDA regulations) finds and documents each of the following: 1. The human subjects are in a life-threatening situation, available treatments are unproven or unsatisfactory, and the collection of valid scientific evidence, which may include evidence obtained through randomized placebo-controlled investigations, is necessary to determine the safety and effectiveness of particular interventions. 2. Obtaining informed consent is not feasible because: a. The subjects will not be able to give their informed consent as a result of their medical condition. b. The intervention under investigation must be administered before consent from the subject's legally authorized representatives is feasible; and c. There is no reasonable way to identify prospectively the individuals likely to become eligible for participation in the clinical investigation. 3. Participation in the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the subjects because: a. Subjects are facing a life-threatening situation that necessitates intervention; b. Appropriate animal and other preclinical studies have been conducted, and the information derived from those studies and related evidence support the potential for the intervention to provide a direct benefit to the individual subjects; and c. Risks associated with the investigation are reasonable in relation to what is known about the medical condition of the potential class of subjects, the risks and benefits of standard therapy, if any, and what is known about the risks and benefits of the proposed intervention or activity. 4. The clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out without the waiver. 5. The proposed investigation plan defines the length of the potential therapeutic window based on scientific evidence, and the investigator has committed to attempting to contact a legally authorized representative for each subject within that window of time and, if feasible, to ask the legally authorized representative contacted for consent within that window rather than proceeding without consent. The investigator will summarize efforts made to contact a legally authorized representative and make this information available to the IRB at the time of continuing review. 6. The IRB has reviewed and approved informed consent procedures and an informed consent document. These procedures and the informed consent document are to be used with subjects or their legally authorized representatives in situations where use of such procedures and documents is feasible. The IRB has reviewed and approved procedures and information to be used when providing an opportunity for a family member to object to a subject's participation in the clinical investigation consistent with paragraph (7)(v) below. 7. Additional protections of the rights and welfare of the subjects will be provided, including, at least: i. Consultation (including, where appropriate, consultation carried out by the IRB) with representatives of the communities in which the clinical investigation will be conducted and from which the subjects will be drawn; ii. Public disclosure to the communities in which the clinical investigation will be conducted and from which the subjects will be drawn, prior to initiation of the clinical investigation, of plans for the investigation and its risks and expected benefits; iii. Public disclosure of sufficient information following completion of the clinical investigation to apprise the community and researchers of the study, including the demographic characteristics of the research population, and its results; iv. Establishment of an independent data monitoring committee to exercise oversight of the clinical investigation; and v. If obtaining informed consent is not feasible and a legally authorized representative is not reasonably available, the investigator has committed, if feasible, to attempting to contact within the therapeutic window the subject's family member who is not a legally authorized representative, and asking whether he or she objects to the subject's participation in the clinical investigation. The investigator will summarize efforts made to contact family members and make this information available to the IRB at the time of continuing review. a. The IRB is responsible for ensuring that procedures are in place to inform, at the earliest feasible opportunity, each subject, or if the subject remains incapacitated, a legally authorized representative of the subject, or if such a representative is not reasonably available, a family member, of the subject's inclusion in the clinical investigation, the details of the investigation and other information contained in the informed consent document. The IRB shall also ensure that there is a procedure to inform the subject, or if the subject remains incapacitated, a legally authorized representative of the subject, or if such a representative is not reasonably available, a family member, that he or she may discontinue the subject's participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled. If a legally authorized representative or family member is told about the clinical investigation and the subject's condition improves, the subject is also to be informed as soon as feasible. If a subject is entered into a clinical investigation with waived consent and the subject dies before a legally authorized representative or family member can be contacted, information about the clinical investigation is to be provided to the subject's legally authorized representative or family member, if feasible. b. The IRB determinations required by § 50.25(a) of this section and the documentation required by § 50.25(e) of this section are to be retained by the IRB for at least 3 years after completion of the clinical investigation, and the records shall be accessible for inspection and copying by FDA in accordance with § 56.115(b). c. Protocols involving an exception to the informed consent requirement under this section must be performed under a separate investigational new drug application (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE) that clearly identifies such protocols as protocols that may include subjects who are unable to consent. The submission of those protocols in a separate IND/IDE is required even if an IND for the same drug product or an IDE for the same device already exists. Applications for investigations under this section may not be submitted as amendments under § 312.30 or 812.35. d. If an IRB determines that it cannot approve a clinical investigation because the investigation does not meet the criteria in the exception provided under § 50.25(a) of this section or because of other relevant ethical concerns, the IRB must document its findings and provide these findings promptly in writing to the clinical investigator and to the sponsor of the clinical investigation. The sponsor of the clinical investigation must promptly disclose this information to FDA, when the project is under the jurisdiction of the FDA and to the sponsor's clinical investigators who are participating or are asked to participate in this or a substantially equivalent clinical investigation of the sponsor, and to other IRBs that have been, or are asked to review this or a substantially equivalent investigation by that sponsor. Additional HHS requirements: HHS 45 CFR 46.101(i): a. In accordance with HHS regulations the ""Emergency Research Consent Waiver"" does not apply to research involving prisoners, fetuses, pregnant women and human in vitro fertilization. b. The IRB must approve the research, waiver, and document that the research activity is subject to regulations codified by the FDA Title 21 CFR part 50 and will be carried out under an FDA investigational new drug application (IND) or an FDA investigational device exemption (IDE). The application for which has clearly identified the protocols that would include subjects who are unable to consent, and c. That: i. The requirements for exception from informed consent for emergency research detailed in title 21 CFR section 50.24 have been met relative to those protocols, or ii. The IRB responsible for the review, approval, and continuing review of the research has approved both the research and a waiver of informed consent and has found and documented that the research is not subject to regulations codified by the FDA at Title 21 CFR part 50 and found and documented and reported to the Office for Protection from Research Risks, HHS, that all the above mentioned conditions have been met relative to the research. *In accordance with HHS and for the purposes of this waiver, ""family member"" means any one of the following legally competent persons: spouses, parents, children (including adopted children), brothers, sisters, and spouses of brothers and sisters, and any individual related by blood or affinity whose close association with the subject is the equivalent of a family relationship.","To approve research that involves neonates of uncertain viability , the following five conditions must be met: 1. Where appropriate, the conduct of preclinical and clinical studies provides data for assessing potential risks; 2. Each individual who provides consent is fully informed of the reasonably foreseeable impact of the research on the neonate; 3. Individuals engaged in the research play no role in determining the viability of a neonate; 4. The IRB determines that: a. The research holds out the prospect of enhancing the probability of survival of the neonate to the point of viability, and any risk is the smallest possible for achieving this objective; or b. The purpose of the research is the acquisition of important biomedical knowledge that cannot be obtained by other means, and the research presents no added risk to the neonate; and 5. The legally effective informed consent of either parent or, if neither parent is able to consent because of unavailability, incompetence, or temporary incapacity, the legally effective informed consent of either parent's legally authorized representative, is obtained in accordance with the regulations that pertain to informed consent.

Upon transfer from the PACU, a discharge assessment, pain score, IVFs infused are documented in PowerChart and discharge time is documented in PowerChart. The PACU documents the name of the receiving nurse. 5. Upon arrival to the floor, the nurse-to-nurse report includes identifying the patient as described in Patient Care Manual: Patient Identification , assessing the patient, checking the PCA or epidural/regional catheter settings, assessing the IV site, and viewing the operative site. The receiving nurse then follows the Patient Care Manual: Patient Admission policy.","The use of the Actemra PFS in IV bags for IV infusion is not recommended. The safety and efficacy of using the Actemra PFS diluted in IV bags as a solution for IV infusion has not been evaluated. Please refer to the locally approved product label for approved method of preparation and administration, important safety information, including Warnings, Precautions, and Contraindications. The risks and benefits of treatment as well as the potential health hazard of a formulation in a non-intended body compartment should be considered prior to initiating Actemra. We fully respect the clinical decisions and choices of healthcare providers and medical institutions. A surge of questions were received from health care providers across the globe on the unintended use of the Actemra PFS diluted in IV bags for IV infusion. To inform on the Actemra PFS diluted in IV bags for infusion, an in-use compatibility study was conducted to investigate the physicochemical stability of Actemra 162 mg solution in PFS with administration materials, including several commonly used IV bags, infusion line combinations with inline filters, and infusion pumps. 1 The in-use compatibility study procedures are summarized below: • Using aseptic technique, IV solutions were prepared by injecting Actemra PFS (162 mg/0.9 mL per single- dose) in 100 mL Sodium Chloride 0.9% IV bags. No saline solution was removed prior to injection. ◦ Two doses were tested. The low dose consisted of 1 PFS injected into a 100 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride bag, leading to a protein concentration of 1.6 mg/mL, corresponding to a dose of 162 mg. The high dose consisted of 6 PFS injected into a 100 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride bag leading to a concentration of 9.2 mg/mL corresponding to a dose of 972 mg. (Note: Actemra doses exceeding 800 mg per infusion are not recommended in rheumatoid arthritis or cytokine release syndrome patients.) • IV bags were prepared by inserting the needle of the syringe and pressing it firmly into the center of the septum of the IV bag at an 90-degree angle. The needle of Actemra PFS is ½ inch (i.e. 12.7 mm) and 26 gauge. • IV solutions were held at 30 ºC for 24 hours under diffused light. • Simulated infusions were conducted using administration sets with infusion line equipped with an inline filter and pumps (Baxter and Braun) capable of delivering the intended dose solution at ambient temperature under diffused light for a duration of 2 hours using an infusion rate of 19.6 mL/hr (infusion volume of 40 mL). • The administration materials included: ◦ Sodium Chloride 0.9% 100 mL IV bags with PVC, PO, PE, and PP as contact surface ◦ Administration sets with PE, PVC, PBD, and PUR as product contact surface ◦ Infusion aids (3-way stopcock) composed of PC ◦ Materials with ABS parts and silicone tubing ◦ IV cannulas/catheter on the infusion line made of PUR or Teflon (PTFE) ◦ 0.2 µm inline filters made of PES or PS • Compatibility of Actemra with other drugs and in-dwelling catheters, such as peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) and central venous access devices (CVADs), were not tested. Under the simulated preparation and administration conditions described above, no meaningful differences were observed in purity (by SEC and IEC), protein content (by UV), color, and turbidity. No increase in subvisible particles (by light obscuration) was observed. Slight differences observed in IEC data between the different set-ups were attributed to the simultaneous use of different HPLC systems, demonstrated by the control samples (undiluted drug product). Due to the high level of siliconization, the use of Venflon Pro Safety catheters from BD may lead to the formation of visible and subvisible particles.","1.

Why is it important to debrief every transport regarding positive andor negative outcomes with all team members involved,0,"1. It is our goal that every transport will be debriefed regarding positive and/or negative outcomes with all Team members involved. 2. Purpose: a. To ensure appropriate follow-up and review of every call with all Team members involved including but not limited to: nurses, EMTs, paramedics, moonlighters and Communications Specialists. b. To ensure timely attention and follow-up for ""red flagged"" incidents that need further discussion and follow-up.","1. After each transport call is completed, Team members will review the call from start to finish, discussing roles, reactions, the medicine, and communication utilizing the Boston Children's Hospital Critical Care Transport Team Debriefing Tool as a guideline. It is the responsibility of the crew chief to ensure debriefing occurs in a timely manner. 2. All aspects of calls will be discussed including positive, negative and any areas for improvement, giving all Team members a chance to voice their perspective(s). 3. Debriefing should occur with all members of the Team including, but not limited to nurses, EMTs/ paramedics, and Communication Center Specialists. 4. If the call is one which meets "" Red Flag "" criteria, it is the responsibility of the Communications Specialists (CS) to notify both nursing management and the Medical Director. In the case of a medical error, it is the responsibility of the Crew Chief to ask the CS to notify both nursing management and the Medical Director for further discussion and review of call. 5. ""Red Flag"" Criteria: a. death on transport b. cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) c. accident in vehicle d. medical error e. Team request","1. After a transport call is completed, Team members will discuss the call from start to finish, discussing roles and how they feel the call transpired, utilizing the Boston Children's Hospital Critical Care Transport Team Debriefing Tool as a guideline. a. All aspects of call will be discussed, positive, negative and any areas for improvement, giving Team members involved a chance to voice their perspective(s). 2. If the call is one which meets "" Red Flag "" criteria, it is the responsibility of the Communications Specialists (CS) to notify both nursing management and the Medical Director. a. In the case of a medical error, it is the responsibility of the Crew Chief to ask the CS to notify both nursing management and the Medical Director for further discussion and review of call. 3. The on duty clinical crew will be taken out-of-service if any call meets "" Red Flag "" criteria and will not resume without permission from either nursing management or the medical director. 4. If the CS is unable to resume his/her duties, they should initiate Boston Children's Hospital Critical Care Transport Team policy 06.02 Check Out Policy. 5. Because of subject sensitivity and the need for peer-to-peer review, all ""Red Flag"" telephone communication will occur on 617-355-3055 or another non-recorded telephone line. 6. "" Red Flag "" Criteria: a. death on transport b. cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) c. accident in vehicle d. medical error e. Team request 7. Once nursing management and the Medical Director have reviewed the call and discussed it with Team members involved, decisions will be made if further intervention is needed. If it is determined that further intervention is needed, the Team member(s) will be encouraged to meet with OCS (Office of Clinician Support) for further debriefing and stress management. 8. Nursing management will be in contact with employee(s) if further intervention is needed to ensure mental health and stress management. 9. If it is the belief of nursing management or the Medical Director that one or all of the crew members involved are unable to complete their shift for either physical or psychological reasons, the crew member(s) will be sent home without penalty. 10. When crew members are sent home following a critical incident, the Communications Center must be notified immediately to ensure that the appropriate steps are taken to maintain a full working Team. 11. If a BCH ambulance is placed out of service due to a critical incident, our vendor ambulance must be notified and used as back up until the BCH ambulance is placed back in service. 12. If nursing coverage is needed following a critical incident, the shift/transport will be paged out. If unable to fill shift/transport with a nurse, the moonlighter will be used for transport calls to maintain a full working Team. 13. If EMT/Paramedic coverage is needed following a critical incident, the shift/transport will be paged out. If unable to fill the transport/shift with an EMT/Paramedic, the contracted vendor ambulance will be used for transport calls to maintain a full working team. 14. If Communications Specialist coverage is needed following a critical incident, nursing management will be notified and arrange coverage. 15. OCS (Office of Clinician Support): The OCS provides clinicians with guidance on how to resolve work-life issues and a forum to openly voice concerns. The OCS is staffed by psychiatrists from the hospital psychiatry consultation service and support is available to clinicians around the clock, seven days a week.","Why debrief? Debriefing is an essential mechanism to enhance interdisciplinary communication about a death and to reduce burnout in providers and rotating trainees. Without debriefing, many team members are left with the feeling that they are alone in their experience of a death. Even a 15 minute debrief can help and set the stage for further conversations and respectful communication between team members. When to debrief, or Why debrief immediately? Scheduling a debriefing for a later date so that everyone who was involved with a death can attend is a very challenging task and often fails to occur. Debriefing immediately does not rule out other debriefings being scheduled later. It can be scheduled before or after bringing child to the morgue but after parents have left the hospital. The neighboring RN or CRN can cover the bedside RN's other patients so that s/he may participate. Who should initiate/lead/attend the debrief? Anyone on the team can (and should) ask for the debrief to be arranged. Generally co-facilitated by fellow or attending and bedside RN, charge RN, or CRN but anyone on the team can lead a debrief (see directions above). The debrief should be multidisciplinary, as perspectives from all of the different disciplines will be helpful and all disciplines can benefit from knowing how the rest of the team is thinking and feeling about the patient and his or her death. Charge nurse, CRN, or bedside nurse should alert RN, RT, CA, clergy, and SW. Fellow/Attending should alert NP's, residents, fellows, and attending. Other services may be invited (General Surgery, Oncology, Neurosurgery, etc.). Where : Conference room, attending office, empty bedspace.","1. For all transports that will exceed 16 hours of duty time, one or more of the following arrangements will be made: a. Additional staff will be provided to care for the patient so as to ensure that Team members are allowed sufficient rest periods in which they have no patient care responsibilities. b. Travel to the destination city will be completed one day prior to patient transport. Facilities will be provided for the Transport Team members to allow for 10 hours of rest before embarking on the return transport. 2. For ground transports: a. The maximum driving time for one Team member on any one transport call is six hours round trip. If the driving time is expected to exceed six hours, an additional driver must be added to the Team configuration before the transport is accepted. b. Two Team members must remain in the front cab during both legs of the transport for all calls expected to last over six hours. c. If there are any safety concerns verbalized by any Transport Team member prior to patient transport, the transport will be aborted, the issues will be discussed with nursing management and/or Medical Director. The transport will be reconsidered only if all parties involved are in agreement that the safety issues have been resolved. 3. For air transports: a. Transport Team members will follow flight safety protocol and direction from our designated third party flight provider, Boston MedFlight. Boston MedFlight conducts annual safety training with the Boston Children's Hospital Transport Team and therefore, is the only service that has been approved for use by our Team. b. If there are any safety concerns verbalized by any Transport Team member prior to patient transport, the transport will be aborted, and the issues will be discussed with nursing management and/or Medical Director. The transport will be reconsidered only if all parties involved are in agreement that the safety issues have been resolved. c.

When is it necessary to obtain the approval of updated information from individuals allowed to consent on behalf of the patient,0,"• A provider can amend or change any information that is included in the informed consent form prior to a patient signing the form. • As the signed informed consent document is part of the patient's medical record, any changes that are necessary after it has been signed should occur in the same manner as amending information in the patient's medical record. To amend a signed informed consent document, the following should occur: ◦ Draw a single line through the incorrect information without obliterating it and record the correct information above, below, or beside it; ◦ Record the date of the correction (note if you are making the amendment on the same date that the consent was signed, you do NOT need to add in the date); ◦ The primary provider who signed the consent should then sign near the corrected information (note that the designated staff can make the amendment and provide to the primary provider to sign); and ◦ If necessary, the reason for amending the informed consent document and what was changed on the form can be documented in the patient's medical record. • If the provider is not able to have an oral discussion and further have the patient sign the form with the updated information, consider obtaining the approval of the updated information from those individuals who are allowed to consent on behalf of the patient as outlined above. Providers should also be aware of the emergency exceptions for not obtaining consent (even an amendment) based on the guidance outlined below. Note: If there are questions about the need to amend or change any information on an informed consent that is not answered above, please consult the BCH Attorney on Call.","• A patient aged 18 or older must be informed of their own health status, provides consent to their own care and treatment, and be involved in developing a plan of care. The discussion should also include any limitations to confidentiality of information from or about the patient. • Consent for Care can be delegated by an adult through a valid Health Care Proxy, using the following guidance: ◦ A Health Care Proxy is an individual at least 18 years of age who is chosen by a competent patient (who must also be at least 18 years of age) to make medical decisions in the event that the patient becomes incapacitated. Please note that a valid healthcare proxy document will allow the proxy to make both medical and/or behavioral health decisions for the individual, unless the proxy document says otherwise. ◦ A Health care proxy is expected to use their substituted judgement to make decisions on behalf of the patient that are consistent with the values and desires of the patient. ◦ ONLY the patient can name a Health Care Proxy. ◦ The health care proxy's authority does not begin until after a determination has been made by a clinician that the individual lacks capacity or the patient has chosen to give authority to their healthcare proxy. ◦ The patient is legally allowed to revoke the healthcare proxy at any time, including during current treatment or hospitalization for a medical and/or behavioral health condition. ◦ An Advance Directive (also called a living will) is a written plan of care that communicates an individual's instructions for future health care choices in the event that the individual becomes incapacitated. In Massachusetts, an advance directive does not provide a legal decision-making authority, but may be used by clinicians, legal guardians, and healthcare proxies as a guide to make decisions in accordance with the individual's wishes. • A competent individual aged 18 or older may also delegate their decision making to any individual through a variety of other methods, including indicating (verbally or other means) to the medical care team which person is able to provide consent, medical decisions, and/or obtain medical information on their behalf. ◦ Depending on the circumstances, verify if the patient may have signed a Delegation of Authority form or a Caregiver Authorization Affidavit. These forms are legally binding documents that are recognized as valid medical order documents to direct care and treatment. ◦ Please note that in Massachusetts the Medical Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) form has replaced the Massachusetts Comfort Care/ Do Not Resuscitate Order Verification Protocol. MOLST is recognized by the state as more appropriately addressing preferences regarding other life- sustaining treatment in addition to resuscitation. While the MOLST is recognized as a valid medical order by the state for outpatient and emergency level services, if the patient is admitted to an inpatient setting, then the admitting clinician should verify that the MOLST form is valid and that the content of the MOLST form is aligned with the current treatment preferences of the patient or patient representative, to the extent possible given patient condition and availability of the patient representative. • A cognitively limited adult patient may not be able to consent if the treating provider determines that the adult patient is not able to understand the proposed procedure, intervention, or treatment. Parents of such patients do not have legal authority to consent on their behalf unless they have been appointed as the guardian (i.e., guardian) by a court. ◦ If it is not clear whether the cognitively limited adult patient has sufficient understanding of a procedure to provide informed consent, or if parents of a cognitively limited adult have not obtained court-appointed guardianship, contact the BCH Attorney on Call to discuss options for obtaining consent. • If it is not clear whether a patient meets the criteria to have legal capacity or there are individuals with legal authority to provide consent for a patient, please consult the BCH Attorney on Call.","When responding to requests for information: • Refer requests from a legal entity , such as a judge, lawyer, or court-appointed individual to the Office of General Counsel. Such requests may include subpoenas or court orders. • Refer requests from the media to Marketing and Communications. All patient information is considered confidential and sensitive. This includes patient demographic, registration, financial, and clinical information. Hospital policies and procedures, and state and federal statutes protect the internal use and external disclosure of patient information. In general, releases and disclosures of patient information via any media require a completed and signed written authorization by the patient/family or guardian. When responding to requests for patient information: • Refer questions about releasing information and appropriate authorizations to the Medical Records Department or Privacy Officer. • Refer requests for patient information that appear suspicious or inappropriate to your supervisor or chief. • Refer requests for a copy of any portion of a patient's Hospital medical record to the Medical Records Department. They will obtain the necessary authorization prior to the release of the medical record. Do not release any Hospital medical record information without approval from the Medical Records Department • When responding to requests for other Hospital confidential information, individuals may only access and retrieve confidential information to which they have access for the performance of their professional job duties and only when strictly necessary to perform their job duties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Policy shall prohibit an employee from accessing or discussing their own employee health information, employee data, or personnel information. Nothing in this policy is intended to interfere with an employee's rights to discuss his or her wages, hours and working conditions, or otherwise exercise his or her rights to engage in protected concerted activity under law.","HHS (45 CFR 46.117(c)) and FDA (21 CFR 56.109(c)(1)) allow the IRB to waive written informed consent for research that meets specific regulatory criteria. 1. For HHS funded research (45 CFR 46.117(c)), the IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds either: a. That the only record linking the subject and the research would be the informed consent form and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. b. Each subject (or legally authorized representative) will be asked whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the research, and the subject's wishes will govern; i. That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context; or ii. If the subjects or legally authorized representatives are members of a distinct cultural group or community in which signing forms is not the norm, that the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and provided there is an appropriate alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained. 2. For FDA regulated research (21 CFR 56.109(c)(1)), the IRB may only waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds: a. That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context. 3. The investigator is required to justify in the protocol how the conditions for waiver of documentation are to be met. 4. The procedure for waiving the requirement for documentation is not intended to circumvent the requirement for informed consent but rather to protect patient privacy. All required information must still be presented and discussed to ensure a voluntary informed consent process. 5. In cases in which the documentation requirement is waived (referred to as ""obtained through a method other than a written document"" in Boston Children's Hospital IRB application and approval materials), the IRB will often require the investigator to provide subjects with written information about the research.","The following is a summary of the justifications and steps that need to be taken in order to conduct emergency research protocols with a waiver of informed consent: 1. Protocol justification: Researchers must provide a detailed description in their protocol that: a. The human subject is in a life-threatening situation, available treatments are unproven or unsatisfactory, and the collection of valid scientific evidence is necessary to determine the safety and effectiveness of particular interventions; b. Obtaining informed consent is not feasible, for three reasons: i. Participation in the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the subjects, ii. The study could not practicably be carried out without the waiver of informed consent; and iii. The study defines the length of the potential therapeutic window and the investigator has committed to attempting to contact a legally authorized representative to ask for consent for each subject within that window of time. 2. Community consultation : Consultation with appropriate community representatives will need to occur before the research begins 3. Public disclosure : Appropriate public disclosure will need to occur prior to the initiation of the study as well at the completion of the study 4. Ongoing attempts to obtain consent : Researchers planning to conduct research that does not include the informed consent of all subjects must provide information and attempt to obtain the consent from the subjects and/or the appropriate relatives or legally authorized representatives on an ongoing basis throughout the conduct of the research and at the conclusion of the research. a. It is also required that information be provided about the clinical investigation to the subject's legally authorized representative or to a relative, if feasible, if the subject dies before consent has been obtained 5. Summaries of attempts to obtain consent : If obtaining informed consent is not feasible and a legally authorized representative is not reasonably available, investigators must document and summarize their attempts to contact family members to obtain their consent. a. This information will need to be submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing review. 6. A separate Investigational New Device (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) - if subject to FDA regulations : Protocols involving an exception to the informed consent requirement under this FDA regulation must be performed under a separate investigational new drug application (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE) that clearly identifies such protocols as protocols that may include subjects who are unable to consent. a. The submission of those protocols in a separate IND/IDE is required even if an IND for the same drug product or an IDE for the same device already exists. b. Applications for investigations under this section may not be submitted as amendments under 312.30 or 812.35. 7. Independent Data Monitoring Committee: An independent data monitoring committee will need to be established. a. Requests for research that fall within this emergency informed consent exemption often take longer periods of time to review, therefore investigators should plan ahead. b. Often, it will be necessary to arrange for meetings with the IRB Chair and administrative staff in addition to the IRB meetings. Other representatives from Boston Children's Hospital, such as public affairs may also need to be contacted and involved.",3,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
What types of testing are included in nutritional testing in the Gastroenterology Procedure Unit,0,"The primary mission of the Gastroenterology Procedure Unit (GPU) is to provide care for patients undergoing a variety of gastrointestinal and medical procedures. These diagnostic and therapeutic procedures are essential for subspecialty care of patients with gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, pancreatic, and nutritional disorders. The GPU is also the procedural home to both the Motility and Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders Center and Aerodigestive Center providing a full array of diagnostic testing protocols for each subspecialty. The testing and treatments provided by the GPU can be both invasive (e.g. colonoscopy and biopsy) and noninvasive (e.g. Esophageal impedance studies, lactose breath testing) To accomplish this mission, the GPU serves as a physical site of care as well as a resource center for the provision of off-site services. The GPU works in partnership with the department of Anesthesia to offer anesthesiologist-administered sedation along with post-sedation or anesthesia recovery for children and young adults. The GPU also serves as a site for patient-oriented clinical research and quality improvement initiatives, and a resource center for patient, family, and staff education. In addition to its primary mission, the GPU also provides space and staff support for the Sedation Service. The Sedation Service staffed by Emergency Medicine & Critical Care physicians credentialed to provide procedural sedation to inpatients and outpatients who require placement of Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters (PICC lines), lumbar puncture, bone marrow biopsy, skin biopsy, joint aspiration, or other minor procedures.","The primary mission of the Gastroenterology Procedure Unit (GPU) is to provide care for pediatric patients undergoing a variety of gastrointestinal procedures. These diagnostic and therapeutic procedures are essential for modern subspecialty care of patients with gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, pancreatic, and nutritional disorders. The GPU is also the procedural home to both the Motility and Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders Center and Aerodigestive Center providing a full array of diagnostic testing protocols for each subspecialty. In this state of the art center anesthesiologist-administered sedation and anesthesia are provided to children of all ages and young adults. The GPU also serves as a site for patient-oriented clinical research and quality improvement initiatives, and a resource center for patient, family, and staff education. The program continually strives to improve the quality of patient care and access to services and to increase awareness and education in the subspecialty areas of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition. This is accomplished through peer review and quality improvement initiates, by maintaining state-of-the-art equipment, by providing family education, and by formal presentations by members of the nursing and physician staff at local, national, and international conferences. The GPU provides expert care for children undergoing gastrointestinal procedures. Both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures are performed with general anesthesia. Outpatient procedures and testing are performed in the GPU, Day Surgery operating rooms, the Radiology Department, and the Nutritional Assessment Lab. Inpatient procedures may be performed in the GPU, ICU, and Radiology Department or in the Main Operating Room Suite. The majority of the patients are seen in outpatient encounters. Presently, the GPU supports endoscopic and gastrointestinal procedures and for the Sedation Service who provide procedural sedation to inpatients and outpatients who require placement of PICC lines, lumbar puncture, bone marrow biopsy, skin biopsy, joint aspiration, or other minor procedures.","The following IRB guidelines for pregnancy testing are implemented as part of a research protocol: 1. An investigator's plan for pregnancy testing is to be consistent with the clinical guidelines unless a justified exception is approved by the IRB and the Department Chair or Division Chief. 2. Protocols may not exclude persons based upon their potential to bear children. There must be justified, scientific rationale to exclude persons of childbearing potential. 3. Massachusetts law requires that a positive pregnancy test result be communicated only to the minor and not to their parents without permission. This includes pregnancy test results obtained during the course of research. 4. The IRB sets an age criterion of 12 years or the onset of menses, as a requirement for pregnancy testing in protocols that may potentially affect a fetus. a. If an investigator proposes to perform pregnancy testing for children under the age of 12 or before the onset of menses, the investigator must justify why this is appropriate for the protocol. b. In determining whether it is acceptable to perform pregnancy testing before age 12 or the onset of menses, the IRB considers the potential for direct benefit offered by the protocol within the context of the research. 5. Adolescents under the age of 12 : For subjects under the age of 12 (if required by the protocol), the investigator is to use their discretion as to the subject's knowledge of and exposure to sexual activities in order to determine whether a separate document is reasonable. 6. Adolescents age 12 and older : The IRB strongly recommends that investigators consider the use of a separate document for adolescents age 12 and older, even when assent is not required by the adolescent. This document is to address pregnancy testing and the need to avoid pregnancy only. 7. Any plan for pregnancy testing must be fully disclosed in the informed consent document. The consent is to include: a. The type of pregnancy testing (blood or urine). b. The frequency of testing (prior to the trial, during, both). c. What will happen if results are positive? d. Who will be informed of the results? e. How confidentiality will be maintained? Sample consent form template language describing pregnancy testing is available.","Medical Clearance Initial medical clearance will be provided by OHS to an employee prior to fit testing and first use of a respirator. This medical clearance determines an employee's physical ability to use a respirator. Medical clearance will also be done on an annual basis prior to annual fit testing. A respirator medical clearance questionnaire will be administered at the time it is determined the employee's job requires the use of a respirator. The questionnaire is reviewed by an Occupational Health Service (OHS) clinician. A physical exam may also be conducted by OHS if any health concerns are raised. If at any time an employee's job or job tasks change so that the use of a respirator becomes necessary, the employee or their supervisor must schedule an appointment with OHS to complete the questionnaire. • Medical clearance records are kept in the employee's health record in the OHS Office. • Information provided to OHS includes type of respirator to be worn, length of time respirator will be worn, and a copy of the OSHA standard. • The Emergency department HAZMAT staff, and Bio Containment Unit (BCU) staff require medical clearance by OHS for the use of PAPR's as referenced within Emergency Management and BCU protocols. The BCU, EH&S, Emergency management, and Emergency Department leadership verify protocol requirements and medical clearance records to be maintained within the OHS record. • Each year employees complete a survey to rule out the need for an additional medical evaluations Fit Testing Baseline fit testing will be done when an individual is assigned to the program, to ensure that the appropriate respirator is selected, has a tight-fitting seal and provides maximum protection and comfort for the wearer. Fit testing is required for the use of N95, full-faced, and half-faced respirators, but is not required for the use of a loose-fitting PAPR. Fit testing is done annually for all participants in the program. BCU staff are also included in the routine fit-testing protocols for clinicians. Training Any employee who wears respiratory protection must receive annual training in the proper selection, use, fitting, limitations, and maintenance of the respirator at the time of fit testing. Staff that fall into the program are captured annually during the fit testing clinic, and this includes medical clearance, completing the appropriate training module and associated quiz, performing hands-on training, and documentation is kept in the employees medical record.","To maintain a comprehensive Preventative Maintenance Program, which includes a written testing and maintenance program for all equipment, included in the program at established intervals.

What are the indications for administering ondansetron to patients presenting at triage with signs and symptoms of gastroenteritis,1,"Indications • Patients greater than or equal to six months of age presenting to triage with signs and symptoms of gastroenteritis including: ◦ Non-bloody, non-bilious vomiting and/or nausea with or without diarrhea or fever ◦ Not exhibiting signs of severe dehydration (e.g. lethargy, sunken eyes, dry mucus membranes) • Patient should be otherwise healthy • Patient must be able to tolerate oral/orally disintegrating tablet dosing Contraindications • Patients with an allergy or adverse reaction to ondansetron • Patients with a history of prolonged QTc","The ideal location of a CVC tip is at the SVC/RA junction in upper extremity and neck lines and at the IVC/RA junction for lower extremity lines. However, placement of the catheter tip into the RA may be acceptable for dialysis and other high-flow indications if adequate flows cannot be established with the tip at the SVC/RA junction. The acceptable location for a CVC catheter tip in patients ≤3 months old (corrected age) is anywhere in the SVC or IVC, but not in the RA unless this is required for high-flow indications (e.g., dialysis) and adequate flows cannot be established at the SVC/RA junction. Other than for high-flow indications, catheters should generally not be left in the RA due to a high risk of line-related complications, and due to the (potentially) high degree of line position variation within the RA during movement and positioning. The acceptable location for a CVC catheter tip in patients >3 months old (corrected age) is anywhere in the SVC, IVC, or in the proximal RA. The proximal RA may be preferable in high-flow indications (e.g., pheresis, dialysis) when inadequate or inconsistent flow is encountered at the SVC/RA junction during intraoperative assessment during placement. Indications for removing the line from the RA include arrhythmia, or radiographic findings that suggest either deformation of the atrial wall by the catheter or projection through the tricuspid valve.","1.

Obtain and document baseline assessment using the Withdrawal Assessment Tool – 1 (WAT-1) prior to weaning. See the WAT-1 Scoring Guidelines. (See Appendix A: Definitions Related to Long-term Exposure to Opioids and Benzodiazepines ): 2. The interdisciplinary team identifies Target WAT-1 score. If the WAT-1 score is greater than target, then the child requires an intervention which may include comfort measures or a rescue medication and or adjusting the weaning plan. a. Note: The WAT-1 score is individualized to the patient. Patients may have higher baseline and target scores if they have clinical conditions with symptoms such as agitation, movement disorder, or diarrhea. When determining Target WAT-1 consider co-morbidities and the individual resiliency of the patient. 3. Identify the patients' level of risk to guide the pace of the wean. Level of risk is determined by the highest score on any of the below items. See the Sedation Weaning Reference for more information. 4. Complete WAT-1 to assess child's withdrawal symptoms at a minimum of every 12 hours and before and after interventions to treat withdrawal (i.e., rescue dose), and document on the appropriate flow sheet. 5.

Before and after administering sedating medications. 6. If the patient is weaning from methadone, start weaning methadone q 24 hours. If patient has moderate to severe signs of withdrawal, wean q 48 hours. Continue assessing for withdrawal symptoms for a minimum of 72 hours after the last dose of opioids. Severe signs and symptoms of withdrawal can appear up to two days after a decrease or cessation of sedation/analgesic medication. May require parental understanding of withdrawal and knowing who to call, even if the medication is no longer being given. 7.

Inform patient that he or she must stay out of bed and awake until the start of the next nap at approximately (time). If there are at least two REM onsets, then a fifth nap does not have to be performed; however, this may lead to less precise mean sleep latency. Patients tested with nasal CPAP during the previous all-night sleep study are tested with CPAP during the naps, although air flow is not measured.","The MWT consists of four trials performed at two-hour intervals. The first trial begins about one and a half to three hours after the patient's usual wake-up time. It is recommended that each trial last 40 minutes if no sleep occur. • Performance of a PSG prior to MWT will be decided by the clinician based on clinical circumstances • A light breakfast is provided about one hour prior to the first trial, and a light lunch is provided immediately after the end of the second trial. • Between trials, the patient is kept out of bed and is visually monitored to ensure that no napping occurs. • During each test, the patient sits in a semi-reclining position (45–90 degrees) on the bed in a dimly lit room (a 7.5 W night light is positioned slightly behind the patient's head so that it is just out of the patient's field of vision), and the patient is told to try to stay awake. The patient will be seated with the back and the head supported by the bedrest (bolster pillow so that the neck is not uncomfortably flexed or extended, or in a chair with backrest. • The recording is terminated after 40 minutes if no sleep occurs. If the patient falls asleep during the 40 minutes, then the trial is terminated after unequivocal sleep, defined as three consecutive epochs of stage N1 sleep or one epoch of any other stage of sleep. • The MWT is recorded with standard polysomnography using the following montage: REOG, LEOG, chin EMG, EEG (C3-M2 or C4-M1), EEG (O2-M1 or O1-M2) and EKG. The mean sleep latency is determined across four trials. • Sleep latency is defined as the time from lights out to the first epoch of any stage of sleep scored according to the most current version of the AASM Scoring Manual v.2.6.0.","1.

In what situations would the hospital retain jurisdiction over research misconduct proceedings as outlined in the policy,0,"BCH is committed to fostering a research environment that promotes responsible research practices in compliance with regulatory and institutional requirements, and to helping prevent Research Misconduct. Covered individuals have an obligation to report allegations of research misconduct and to provide evidence to the RIO. Allegations should be specific. Individuals should not discuss the allegation(s) with others prior to discussion with the RIO. BCH will respond to each Allegation in a thorough, competent, objective, and fair manner, and will take reasonable steps to conduct an impartial and unbiased Research Misconduct proceeding. Individuals are required to inform the RIO immediately of any attempted violation of procedural integrity, or any breach of confidentiality or privacy. The RIO will address any concerns regarding personal, professional, of financial conflict of interest among individuals involved in the proceeding. A. Non-Retaliation Through the RIO, BCH will take all reasonable and practical steps to protect good faith Complainants , witnesses, and panel members, their positions and reputations, and counter potential or actual retaliation against them. B. Confidentiality and Privacy To the extent feasible, all individuals involved in a Research Misconduct proceeding shall make diligent efforts to limit disclosure of information only to those who have a need to know, in order to minimize damage to the reputation of individuals, protect the confidentiality of the Respondent and Complainant, and of research records or evidence from which research subjects might be identified. The RIO can, at his/her discretion, communicate any aspect of the matter covered by this Policy with other agencies, departments, and offices whose jurisdiction or interests are implicated by the alleged misconduct and take necessary actions to protect the scientific integrity of the project. C. Cooperation Individuals involved in a Research Misconduct proceeding are expected to fully participate and cooperate in good faith. Obstruction of any aspect of the proceeding may itself constitute evidence of Research Misconduct. Obstruction includes intentionally withholding or destroying evidence in violation of a duty to disclose or preserve; falsifying evidence; encouraging, soliciting, or giving false testimony; and attempting to intimidate witnesses, potential witnesses, or potential leads to witnesses or evidence. D. Coordination with Other Academic Institutions Harvard Medical School (""HMS"")- If the Respondent had an appointment as fellow or faculty at HMS at the time of the alleged Research Misconduct, the RIO shall confer and discuss the logistics of joint review with HMS. The RIO, following consultation with the Compliance Department, may choose to delegate any or all of the functions described in the Policy to HMS, for resolution according to the ""Principles and Procedures for Dealing with Allegations of Faculty Misconduct."" The decision of whether to delegate and what policy is applicable shall be made in accordance with the following criteria and conditions: a. Substantial involvement of full-time Harvard faculty or fellow as co-investigators in a research project; b. Substantial involvement of investigators from Harvard-affiliated hospitals other than the BCH in a research project; c. Substantial involvement of Harvard students in a research project; d. Involvement of BCH medical staff so senior as to call into question ability of BCH-specific processes to be fair and neutral; and e. Funding by HMS or HMS is the primary site receiving sponsored funds. BCH shall retain jurisdiction over part or all proceedings and apply this Policy when the following conditions are present: a. All significant witnesses and all Respondents are employees of or otherwise directly affiliated with BCH; b. BCH personnel have subject matter expertise and availability to undertake fact-finding in regard to the subject matter of the Allegations; c. When other institutions' personnel are involved, the other institutions' RIOs express a preference for BCH' s process as opposed to HMS' s process and agree to full cooperation with the BCH process; and d. Funding by BCH for the research or BCH is the primary site receiving funds. Howard Hughes Medical Institute (""HHMI"")- If the Respondent is an employee of HHMI at the time of the alleged Research Misconduct, RIOs will jointly decide whether BCH will apply this Policy or whether the HMS or HHMI Policy on Research Misconduct will apply. Other Institutions- If the Respondent is an employee at other non-Harvard-affiliated institution at the time of the alleged Research Misconduct, the RIO shall coordinate further review with the other institution. RIOs at impacted institutions jointly determine which institution will bear primary responsibility. BCH is committed to sharing of information and keeping other institutions informed as to the proceedings, where the interest of both BCH and other institutions are significantly impacted.","Boston Children's Hospital is committed to assuring that all individuals who perform research under its jurisdiction are appropriately qualified to perform the roles assigned. All human subjects research studies conducted at Boston Children's Hospital must designate an individual, qualified by training and experience, to serve as the Principal Investigator (PI). Principal Investigators are responsible for assuring that individuals listed on their research protocols are appropriately qualified, trained, supervised and credentialed, if appropriate, in accordance with Boston Children's Hospital institutional credentialing requirements. Research teams consist of different roles and the nature of the research activity will determine the extent of the training, expertise, and credentialing required. Those involved with recruiting or obtaining consent from research subjects or conducting research assessments may have more requirements. For example, individuals who have limited roles such as data abstraction, coding or analysis with identifiable information will have fewer requirements. Boston Children's Hospital also recognizes that collaborative efforts exist among institutions and individuals who are not part of the Boston Children's Hospital workforce/staff may be asked to assist in conducting a research protocol under the jurisdiction of the Boston Children's Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB). In most of these situations an established Reliance Agreement eliminates the need for duplicate IRB review at multiple institutions; however, it does not eliminate the need for assuring that applicable hospital policies concerning training, credentialing, and oversight are followed in accordance with the role individuals play in the research.","If school staff, teachers or personnel perform research procedures or release private identifiable information about students, the school may be considered engaged in research. This may include active recruitment, obtaining consent, performing research assessments or interventions. If a school is engaged in research, special considerations will need to be made as to whether the school must obtain their own IRB review or whether the school signs an agreement to work under the jurisdiction of the Boston Children's Hospital IRB. Schools that are only used as a site for research and permit the Boston Children's Hospital investigators to perform all the research procedures, including recruitment and obtaining consent would not be considered engaged in research.","Industry-Sponsored Research As part of the clinical trial agreement negotiations, the Sponsor will be required to pay for treatment of illness or injury suffered by a research subject that directly results from participation in the research. These terms are negotiated as part of the clinical trial agreement. In addition, it is the policy of Boston Children's Hospital that, other than what is set forth in the procedure section in the below-mentioned Clinical Trial contract template language, no clinical trial contract shall permit the Sponsor to limit its own indemnification, or shift to subjects its indemnification risk with respect to claims or causes of action that arise from the conduct of the Sponsor, whether related to the manufacturing, distribution or quality of a test article, or with respect to the actions of the Sponsor in design, conduct and reporting of the research. Governmentally or Philanthropically Funded Research In situations where the funding source is the government or a philanthropic institution or foundation, Boston Children's Hospital will provide reasonably necessary treatment for an injury or illness suffered by a human subject which is directly related to participation in the study, provided that the Institutional Review Board (IRB) has approved the study and the investigator has performed it in the manner in which the IRB has approved it. 1. In situations where the cost of research-related treatments could be covered by a subject's insurance, insurance may be billed consistent with applicable laws, agreements, and regulations. 2. In situations where insurance will not cover treatment for research-related injuries or illness, Boston Children's Hospital will provide treatment at no cost to the subject, but will not cover costs at another facility except in an emergency directly related to the research, or if special arrangements were made and approved by Boston Children's Hospital in advance. Internally Funded Studies Studies which have no external funding should provide medical care to subjects on the same terms as governmentally or philanthropically funded studies.","Considerations in the Use of Sedation or Anesthesia Sedation and anesthesia are typically not used for research imaging. The IRB has a policy on the extension of sedation or anesthesia administered for clinical imaging to enable additional research imaging, which should be consulted. The use of sedation or anesthesia for an extended period of research imaging would typically be regarded as more than minimal risk, and would require the potential for direct benefit for the patient in order to be carried out. Considerations in the Use of Gadolinium Gd-based contrast agents may be retained in the body. They may cause an anaphylactic reaction. The introduction of a Gd-based contrast agent would therefore pose a more than minimal risk under many research imaging circumstances. The use of such an agent in research should be overseen by a Data Safety Monitoring Board, and carried out only with IRB approval.",2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

It is our goal that every transport will be debriefed regarding positive and/or negative outcomes with all Team members involved. 2. Purpose: a. To ensure appropriate follow-up and review of every call with all Team members involved including but not limited to: nurses, EMTs, paramedics, moonlighters and Communications Specialists. b. To ensure timely attention and follow-up for ""red flagged"" incidents that need further discussion and follow-up.","• Verbal coaching is an informal process for addressing performance issues and other concerns prior to taking formal disciplinary action. The primary purpose of verbal coaching is to give an employee an opportunity to address and correct issues promptly. • Verbal coaching consists of an informal discussion between the manager and the employee. The discussion typically involves: identifying the issue that requires correction and stating the manager's expectations, the time frame for improvement, and the consequences to the employee if the individual fails to improve. • This conversation should be documented, a copy given to the employee and a copy placed in the employee's personnel file.","1. The decision to participate in research should be a family-centered decision with special consideration and attention given to each parent and the pertinent child or adolescent. In some situations, it may be appropriate to spend time with the child/adolescent alone, without the parent/guardian present. This may make it easier for the child to ask questions and not feel coerced or unduly influence by a parent/ guardian. 2. Consideration is to be given to the best method for obtaining consent: parental permission and assent , and is to include attention to such factors as the nature, location, urgency of the research, and family dynamics. 3. Consideration is to be given to the timing and location of all communications concerning informed consent (assent/parental permission), including when and where it is given. Potential subjects/parents are not to be presented with all the information at once, or at the last minute. 4. The amount of time required will vary with protocols and individuals. Busy and hectic environments may also distract a child/adolescent/parent's attention. When possible, all family members are to be given time to think about whether they want to participate and are to have the opportunity to speak with others before proceeding. 5. The consent process may be segmented: conversations, further questions, and the signing of the informed consent form may take place over several visits, and the time between discussion of the protocol and the signing of the consent may vary. 6. Investigators are to consider innovative and creative ways to provide children and families with information about the study during the informed consent process. Examples include: a. Videotapes/photographs of research procedures, b. Pre-visits to the site of the research to see equipment (e.g., MRIs), c. Encouraging and arranging for potential families to speak with families/patients who have participated in research. d. Distributing educational material about clinical research or specific types of research procedures (e.g., gene therapy, cancer trial pamphlets). 7. The burden of ensuring that a parent/guardian, child/adolescent who might participate in research genuinely understands the research falls on the researcher. 8. It is recommended that the researcher not only answer questions, but also ask questions to be certain that family members understand the research before a subject enrolls in a study. 9. Asking questions can further discussion, prompt the subject and parents to think more carefully about their involvement, and help the researcher decide whether the parent/guardian and child/adolescent adequately understand the research. The questions that an investigator may consider asking are to be open-ended and nondirective. Examples include the following: Instead of saying this: Ask this: Do you understand the research and what Could you explain to me what we are going to ask will happen? you to do in this study? This will help me be sure that you understand the research. Instead of saying this: Ask this: Do you have questions? What more would you like to know about this study? Do you understand there are some good and Can you tell me the possible good and bad things bad things that could happen if you take this that may happen fi you take this experimental drug? drug?",This policy and procedure describes the purpose and the protocol of how to work an outpatient account when a referral/prior authorization is required for an out of network insurance that is under the HARP Protocol.

The IND application must contain information in three broad areas: 1. Animal Pharmacology and Toxicology Studies - Preclinical data to permit an assessment as to whether the product is reasonably safe for initial testing in humans. For many Sponsor-Investigator (or investigator-initiated INDs), this requirement can be met by submitting a Letter of Authorization cross- referencing a third party's regulatory application. Also included in the IND are data on any previous experience with the drug in humans. 2. Manufacturing Information - Information pertaining to the composition, manufacturer, stability, and controls used for manufacturing the drug substance and the drug product. This information is assessed to ensure that the company can adequately produce and supply consistent batches of the drug. For many Sponsor-Investigator (or investigator-initiated INDs), this requirement can be met by submitting a Letter of Authorization cross-referencing a third party's regulatory application. 3. Clinical Protocols and Investigator Information - Detailed protocols for proposed clinical studies to assess whether the initial-phase trials will expose subjects to unnecessary risks. Also, information on the qualifications of clinical investigators to assess whether they are qualified to fulfill their clinical trial duties. Finally, commitments to obtain informed consent from the research subjects, to obtain review of the study by an institutional review board (IRB), and to adhere to the investigational new drug regulations. Boston Children's Hospital Internal Review Process The IND/IDE Resource Group (IIRG) is a group of experts from across the hospital that internally reviews the IND application prior to submitting to the FDA. All Investigators seeking to submit an IND to the FDA will first be required to participate in this internal review process to: 1. Review the proposed protocol 2. Review requirements of the institution and of sponsoring an IND 3. Provide recommendations for how the Investigator can meet their regulatory obligations. FDA Submission 1. Once the IND is submitted, the sponsor must wait 30 calendar days before initiating any clinical trials. 2. During this time, the FDA has the opportunity to review the IND for safety to assure that research subjects will not be subjected to unreasonable risk. 3. At the end of this 30-day review period, the FDA may issue a ""Study May Proceed"" letter or a clinical hold letter. Information to be submitted with the IRB Application Complete IND information must be submitted with any protocol submitted to the IRB that involves an investigational drug or biologic. 1. Investigators are required to submit IND information provided by the sponsor, or if the investigator is also the sponsor a copy of the letter from the FDA that assigns the IND. 2. The IRB will not release a final approval until all IND information is complete. 3. Protocol administrators will be responsible for making sure this information is obtained prior to release of the IRB approval notification and informed consent document. 4. If there is any question as to whether an IND is required, the IRB may require, as part of the review and approval process, that the investigator contact a Boston Children's Hospital Regulatory Affairs Specialist or the FDA to discuss the protocol and to determine if an IND is required. 5. Investigators who propose to use investigational or marketed drugs for unapproved indications must also follow FDA regulations 21 CFR 50 and 56. a. For the most part, the FDA regulations are the same as HHS regulations 45 CFR 46. The regulations are similar with regard to IRB organization, composition, procedure, record keeping, and criteria for approval of research protocol, and informed consent documentation. b. At the time of a continuing review, if an investigator is the sponsor of an IND, a copy of the annual report to the FDA will be requested.","It is the responsibility of the Sponsor (including Sponsor-Investigator or Principal Investigator) to justify why a proposed study meets the requirements for exemption from the IND regulations. 1. Boston Children's Hospital's Regulatory Affairs, in conjunction with the IRB, will determine whether the justification is sufficient to proceed, or whether confirmation by the FDA is necessary. 2. Investigators are advised to review the FDA Guidance document, Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) — Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND . Investigator Responsibilities Responsibilities of an investigator participating in a study under an IND are detailed in Subpart D of 21 CFR 312. For all investigations subject to IND regulations: 1.

If the infant has not had a hearing screening at the birth hospital or if the infant requires a repeat screen as determined by the guidelines in this policy, the medical team: • informs the parent/legal guardian of the significance of the hearing screenings. • contacts Audiology (ext 5-6461 or via Newborn Hearing Screen Request in EHR) to alert of the need for the screening prior to discharge. The Audiology Assistant performs the hearing screen. The Audiologist: • Reports normal results in patient chart (paper, if applicable, and in EHR) and communicates results to the parent/legal guardian. If the parent/legal guardian is not available, results are conveyed via telephone and/or postal mail. • Reports abnormal results to the medical team and to the parent/legal guardian, and documents results in the EHR. A member of the medical team and/or the audiologist discusses with the parent/legal guardian abnormal results, the result implications, and need for further testing. The Audiologist gives a list of DPH-approved diagnostic test centers to the parent/legal guardian and instructs him/her to make a follow-up diagnostic audiological evaluation appointment at an approved test center. If the infant does not pass the hearing test prior to discharge, the nurse documents that the follow-up appointment has been scheduled on the Newborn Hearing Screening Test Result form located in the ""consults"" section of the patient's chart. • If the follow-up appointment has not been scheduled, the nurse assists the parent/legal guardian with this process and documents the time and date of the appointment on the appropriate line of the form.","1.

Hearing Screening must occur at the birth hospital before initial discharge to home or at a referring hospital (if the newborn is directly transferred from the birth hospital) before initially discharged to home a. BCH clinicians should obtain and document in the patient's chart information from the transferring hospital if a hearing screen was performed and the results of such screen. If the screen was not successful, missed, or the infant did not pass prior to the transfer, BCH shall conduct the screen prior to initial discharge to home. b. BCH clinicians must notify the parent(s)/guardian(s) both orally and in writing if a heaing screening was not successful, missed, or the infant did not pass. If a repeat or further screening cannot occur prior to discharge, the parent(s)/guardian(s) should be informed in writing of the inability to test prior to discharge, and the following should occur: i. Notify the infant's primary care provider; and ii. An appointment should be made at a DPH approved screening center such as BCH (note based on lack of availability of appointments at available locations, parents can also be provided with a list of sites that conduct such diagnostic screening for their choice). 3. If an infant cannot be screened due to delayed physiological development or physiological instability (related to but not limited to an illness or premature birth) as determined by the treating clinician, the infant shall be screened prior to discharge and as early as the identified physiological development or stability will permit reliable screening. 4.

Conditions that warrant re-screening include, but are not limited to, history of ECMO, bilirubin level >20 and/or hyperbilirubinemia requiring an exchange transfusion, gentamicin dosing>72 hrs, furosemide>7 doses, culture-positive sepsis, and meningitis.","A cochlear implant (CI) is an electronic device that provides a sensation of hearing to individuals with severe to profound hearing loss. While it does not provide or restore “normal” hearing, it does allow patients access to sounds and spoken language. Most children with good language abilities, listening therapy, and full-time use of the device can use this sound to understand spoken language. Note that a CI differs from a bone anchored hearing system (BAHS) or bone anchored hearing aid (BAHA), which provides amplification by sending sounds directly to the inner ear via bone conduction. The immunization guidelines listed below do NOT apply to patients with BAHS/BAHA. 1","A training program is in place for all employees who are exposed to noise at or above the OSHA Action Level and affected employees must participate in the training program. The training program includes the following: • The effects of noise on hearing. • The purpose of hearing protectors and the type(s) specifically used in the department being trained. The advantages, disadvantages, and attenuation of various types, and instructions on selection, fitting, use, and care of the hearing protectors. • The purpose of audiometric testing and an explanation of the test procedures.

What precautions should be taken in the transport environment for a patient with an AICD to avoid interference with AICD performance,1,"Maintain precautions as indicated in the table below when transporting a patient to other areas. Inform the area receiving the patient in advance regarding the need for precautions. When transporting a patient on precautions within the healthcare facility, the appropriate use of barriers to prevent spread of the infectious agent is based upon the mode of transmission and the patient's circumstances (e.g., age, mental status, etc.). For example, because it may be difficult for an infant to wear a mask, the transporter may need to wear a face mask and make arrangements to avoid other patients, staff and visitors in route (such as using an empty elevator). The patient should not be placed in a waiting room but be taken directly to a single patient room in the department (e.g., exam room) with the door closed.

The purpose of a hazard assessment is to determine whether hazards are present or likely to be present in the workplace which would require the use of PPE. If such hazards are present, or are likely to be present, BCH shall: • Select the appropriate type of PPE that will protect employees from the hazards identified. • Communicate PPE selection decisions to each affected employee. • Provide PPE that properly fits each affected employee. • Conduct and document appropriate employee training in the use and limitations of the equipment provided. BCH department managers/supervisors are responsible for conducting Hazard Assessments in their designated areas with assistance provided by the EH&S department when needed. Each of the basic hazards will be reviewed and a determination made as to the type, level of risk, and seriousness of potential injury. Consideration will be given to the possibility of exposure to several hazards at once. The general procedure for determining appropriate protective equipment is to: • Identify the potential hazards and the type of protective equipment that is available, and what protection it provides (i.e., splash protection, impact protection, etc.) • Compare the capabilities and limitations of various types of PPE with the hazards associated with the environment (e.g., sharp or rough materials, vibration, projectiles, radiation intensities) • Select the PPE which provides a level of protection greater than the minimum required to protect employees from the hazards • Select PPE that will fit each employee properly and provides protection from the hazard",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

These units will often have a (1) microprocessor-based temperature control with a digital temperature sensor and (2) fan-forced air circulation with powerful fans and multiple cool air vents to promote uniform temperature in the unit. • Freezer unit used for COVID-19 storage must be a standalone unit. ◦ A standalone freezer unit must have its own power cord to connect to your wall outlet and cannot be a dual unit that contains refrigerator and freezer utilizing the same power cord. • Please contact the Vaccine Unit when purchasing a new storage unit so that the unit can be approved before your purchase and added to your site’s MIIS account once acquired. • The use of a Digital Data Logger (DDL) is REQUIRED in all units storing state-supplied COVID-19 vaccines. A DDL provides the most accurate storage unit temperature information, including details of how long a unit has been operating outside the recommended temperature range. Unlike a simple minimum/ maximum thermometer, which only shows the coldest and warmest temperatures reached in a unit, a DDL provides detailed information on all temperatures recorded at present intervals. To be in compliance a DDL must have the following features: ◦ Detachable probe that best reflects vaccine temperatures (e.g., a probe buffered with glycol, glass beads, sand, or Teflon®)† ◦ Alarm for out-of-range temperatures ◦ Low-battery indicator† ◦ Current, minimum, and maximum temperature display‡ ◦ Recommended uncertainty of +/-0.5° (+/-1° F) ◦ Logging interval (or reading rate) that can be programmed by the user to measure and record temperatures at least every 30 minutes ◦ DDLs with a current and valid Certificate of Calibration Testing. • Sites are required to review and acknowledge DDL temperature data every day the practice is open, at least once at the beginning of the day and once at the end of the day; this is critical for vaccine viability. ◦ The temperature readings on the storage unit itself cannot be used in place of a digital temperature monitoring device. ◦ Providers are required to acknowledge the temperature on the digital data logger twice daily. This must be document in the digital temperature log report. The digital data logger report must show: ▪ Date ▪ Time ▪ Minimum/maximum temperature during the day ▪ Average temperature during the day ▪ Indicate Alarms/Out of Range temperature ▪ Time of acknowledgement • Digital temperature report must be in a PDF format, so it can be uploaded to the MIIS. ◦ If using state supplied-DDL you can just press the “read” bottom twice a day, once on the am, once at the pm to record your temperature acknowledgement. • Handwritten temperature logs are not acceptable. • Temperature logs from the digital temperature monitoring device must be uploaded into your site’s MIIS profile at the time of a site visit or upon request . You must download and save your digital temperature logs reports at least once monthly, they must be kept for at least 3 years. If the storage unit experienced any out-of-range temperatures, please refer to the “Temperature Out of Range” section of this document below. • A DDL must be in use at all times including during transport of vaccines and temporary storage of vaccines on other units. Provider sites are responsible for having as many DDLs as needed based on the nature of their practice to have all state supplied vaccine always accompanied by a DDL when storing, transporting and/or administering in a mobile clinic. Transporting COVID-19 Vaccine • Obtain and store an adequate number/amount of appropriate packing containers and materials (e.g., frozen and refrigerated gel packs, bubble wrap) needed to pack vaccines for safe transport. • Place a digital data logger and associated glycol bottle in each packing container near the vaccine to monitor the temperatures. • Do not store the vaccines in the packing container until the packing container is reding in-range temperatures (2°C to 8°C) on the digital data logger attached. • Record the time and temperature when vaccine was removed from the storage units and placed in the containers at the beginning and end of the transport on the Temperature Troubleshooting log . • Vaccine should not be transferred more than one time. • For transporting vaccines between site locations, please refer to the linked Vaccine Transport Guide from CDC at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/storage/downloads/emergency-transport.pdf Transportation when thawed • Care must be taken to ensure vaccine does not re-freeze during transport. • Vaccine must be protected as much as possible from drops, shocks, and vibration whether in the carton, vial, case or cooler. • Vaccine should be transported in the carton whenever possible. • If transport must be conducted at the vial level, the vial should be placed with padding material (ex. bubble wrap) to minimize movement during transport. • Transport in insulated containers qualified to maintain 2°C to 8°C for the duration of transport. • Secure transport containers to prevent unnecessary movement. • Allowable timelines for transport of thawed vaccine are shown below. Total transport time should not exceed 12 hours in total. ◦ Transport while walking or using hand cart: not to exceed 1 hour ◦ Vehicle transport: not to exceed 12 hours Temperatures Out of Range If there are out of range temperatures, suspend vaccine administration, quarantine the vaccine, upload digital temperature logs to the MIIS, and immediately contact the manufacturer.

Assess Children and Adolescents for Need of Influenza Vaccination ◦ Follow the Protocol for Administration of Influenza Vaccine ◦ All children and teens 6 months of age and older are recommended to receive influenza vaccination each year. ◦ Infants ≥6 months and Children <9 years: The number of doses needed per flu season is dependent upon vaccination history (see below): ▪ One dose: If the patient received ≥2 doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine prior to July 1 preceding the current flu season start. The 2 doses need not have been received during the same season or consecutive seasons. ▪ Two doses (separated by ≥4 weeks) if any of the following: ▪ It is the patient's first season of vaccination. ▪ Patient received ≤1 dose of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine prior to July 1 preceding the current flu season start. ▪ If vaccination history cannot be determined. ▪ Note: A child turning 9 years of age between the first and second dose should still receive 2 doses. 2. Screen for Contraindications and Precautions Contraindications for use of all influenza vaccines Do not give influenza vaccine to a child or adolescent who has experienced a serious systemic or anaphylactic reaction to a prior dose of any influenza vaccine or or to any of its components (except egg). For a list of vaccine components, refer to the manufacturer's package insert (www.immunize.org/fda) or go to www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf. Contraindications only for use of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV; FluMist, nasal spray) Do not give live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV; nasal spray) to a child or adolescent who: ◦ is pregnant ◦ is age 2 through 4 years who has received a diagnosis of asthma or who has experienced wheezing or asthma within the past 12 months, based on a health care provider's statement or medical record ◦ is immunocompromised due to any cause (including immunosuppression caused by medications or HIV infection) ◦ is age 6 months through 17 years and is receiving aspirin- or salicylate-containing medicine ◦ received influenza antivirals (e.g., amantadine, rimantadine, zanamivir, oseltamivir, baloxavir, or peramivir) within the previous 48 hours ◦ is a close contact of or who provides care for a severely immunosuppressed person who requires a protective environment Precautions for use of all influenza vaccines ◦ Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever ◦ History of Guillain-Barré syndrome within 6 weeks of a previous influenza vaccination Precautions for use of LAIV only ◦ Age 5 years or older with asthma ◦ Other chronic medical conditions that might predispose the person to complications of influenza infection (e.g., other chronic pulmonary, cardiovascular [excluding isolated hypertension], renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, or metabolic disorders [including diabetes mellitus]) note regarding patients with egg allergy: People with egg allergy of any severity can receive any recom- mended and age-appropriate influenza vaccine (i.e., inactivated influenza vaccine [IIV], recombinant influenza continued on the next page vaccine [RIV], or LAIV]) that is otherwise appropriate for their health status. Most influenza vaccines (except RIV and cell-cultured IIV) are egg cultured and may have trace amounts of egg protein. For people with a history of reactions to egg involving any symptom other than hives (e.g., angioedema or swelling, respiratory distress, light- headedness, or recurrent emesis), or who required epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention, the selected vaccine should be administered in a medical setting (e.g., health department or physician office). Vaccine administration should be supervised by a healthcare provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic conditions. 3. Provide Vaccine Information Statements Provide all patients (or, in the case of minors, their parent, or legal representative) with a copy of the most current federal Vaccine Information Statement (VIS). Provide non-English speaking patients with a copy of the VIS in their native language, if one is available and desired; these can be found at www.immunize.org/vis. (For information about how to document that the VIS was given, see section 6 titled ""Document Vaccination."") 4. Order and Prepare to Administer Vaccine Order the influenza vaccine via the appropriate PowerPlan. For vaccine that is to be administered intramuscularly , choose the needle gauge, needle length, and injection site according to BCH policy For LAIV, which is administered intranasally , prepare the vaccine according to directions in the package insert. 5. Administer Influenza Vaccine according to the age of patient and desired route of vaccination described below: type of vaccine age group dose route instructions* Inactivated 6–35 Afluria: Intramuscular Administer vaccine in anterolateral thigh influenza months 0.25 mL (IM) muscle; alternatively, children age 12 vaccine (IIV) Fluarix: through 35 months may receive injection in 0.5 mL deltoid muscle.

Document Vaccination Document each patient's vaccine administration information and follow up in the following places: Medical record: Document the required vaccine fields in the EMR. Personal immunization record card: Record the date of vaccination and the name/location of the administering clinic, where applicable. Immunization Information System (IIS) or ""registry"": The EMR will automatically report the vaccination to the MIIS. 7. Be Prepared to Manage Medical Emergencies per BCH policies and protocols Be prepared for management of a medical emergency related to the administration of vaccine. To prevent syncope in older children, vaccinate patients while they are seated or lying down and consider observing them for 15 minutes after receipt of the vaccine. For severe reactions, activate emergency response per the area protocol. EPINEPHrine autoinjectors will be available in all areas where influenza vaccines are given. If the patient develops a severe reaction, including but not limited to hives and shortness of breath, the nurse may administer a dose of EPINEPHrine per the chart below: 8.

What recommendations should the technologist make to the patient before discharging them from the facility at the end of the study,0,"1. Technologist will ensure that all needed supplies and ancillary equipment required for bedside recording are checked prior to taking System to the patient's bedside for recordings. 2. Technologist shall be responsible for coordinating the bedside study prior with patient's floor nurse and any other personnel staff associated with care of the patient (e.g. respiratory therapy, GI etc.). 3. The technologist shall explain the sleep procedure to the patient and/or legal guardian. 4. Scalp should be measured according to the 10-20 Electrode Measurement System (refer to display below). Electrodes shall be applied using paste. In addition, all non-cephalic recording parameter will be applied. Universal precautions (gloves) should be used while touching the patient during head measurement and lead placement including removal . 5. An electrode impedance check should be conducted prior to the start of each polysomnography recording. Electrodes testing over 10Kohms should be fixed and retested until the impedance reads no greater than 10K ohm. 6. All polysomnography should be recorded with audiovisual with the camera clearly focused on the patient at all times. 7. Appropriate comments should be made throughout the recording regarding patient's position, behavior, and state of consciousness. Artifacts should be investigated and resolved and noted on recordings. 8. If significantly abnormal findings are recorded, the technologist should contact the patient's nurse and/or floor resident. In some situations, involving the on-call Sleep MD is appropriate. 9. Patients having clinical seizures during recordings, the technologist should stay near the patient (leave machine recording), and alert the unit/floor nursing staff for assistance, and make notes about the clinical signs of the seizure.","1. If a mask leak occurs, the tech should first fix the leakage before raising the pressure. Otherwise, the final pressure setting chosen for the patient may be too high. Once the mask leak has been fixed, decrease the pressure to the last setting where mouth breathing and/or mask leakage was not present, and then re- titrate as indicated. Make sure to document directly on the study the steps taken to resolve the leak and the type of masks used. Pressure settings usually do not need to be set as high with a nasal-mask than with a full-face mask. 2. The recoding technologist should document directly on the study at least every 30 minutes. 3. If the patient takes a break from wearing the mask, do not decrease the CPAP pressure on attempted return to sleep unless the patient remains awake for 15 minutes or the patient specifically requests that the pressure be lowered. 4. Do not raise pressure settings for central apneas. If the patient develops central apneas, periodic breathing, pressure setting may need to be lowered. 5. The use of bi-level positive airway pressure may be indicated if the patient is unable to tolerate CPAP secondary due to any of the following: 1) Persistent mouth breathing despite use of a full-face mask/chin strap; 2) Inability to exhale against higher expiratory pressures (typically beginning anywhere from 15 to 20 cm of water); or 3) Frequent central apneas. Document directly on the study why the patient is being switched from CPAP to Bi-PAP. 6. Ensure that supine sleep has been seen on the chosen setting. Going above the chosen setting by one or two cm of water to show range may be helpful to ensure that the correct pressure has been established. Pressure levels may need to be increased more quickly during REM sleep given the limited amount of REM during sleep and the need to treat events during this stage.","If there are multiple visits, every effort should be made to provide the subject with remuneration after each visit, instead of waiting until the subject completes all or a group of the study requirements. Withholding payment until the end of the study may make the subject feel that they are required to complete all the visits, when in fact, the study likely does not require completion of all visits to receive remuneration. The IRB recognizes that there may be circumstances in which it is appropriate to distribute remuneration for multiple study visits at one time. If provided with sufficient rationale, the IRB will approve grouped payments as appropriate. When designing the remuneration policy for the protocol, time consuming practices should be minimized and avoided where possible. 1. Example: Indicating that travel expenses will be reimbursed based on actual miles traveled, which require the payment to be calculated for each subject is very time consuming. 2. Recommendation: Standardizing the reimbursement amount and group it based on the number of miles the family traveled for the research visit (e.g. 1-25, 25-75, 75 and over, etc.).","• Document the facility name, facility NP/MD providers' names, and facility phone number in the Patient Profile section of the PAEF • Obtain and review the patient's medication list, admission H&P, and most recent daily progress note from the facility • Complete a pre-op phone call with the patient's facility RN/NP/MD and legal guardian ◦ This is still required of patients coming for an in-person PCCC visit because they may arrive at BCH with a facility staff member who is not familiar with the complete medical history ◦ There is no need to call the legal guardian in advance if: ▪ The legal guardian will be present at the pre-op visit ▪ The legal guardian is DCF ◦ Review the patient's medication and health history with the facility NP/MD ◦ Review the ""Patient Navigation Tool"" (see end of this document) with the facility NP/MD and update the PAEF accordingly ▪ This is a reference tool/document and should not be sent to medical records ◦ Obtaining anesthesia consent: ▪ If the legal guardian will not be present at the pre-op visit or DOS, arrange for anesthesia consent via phone in advance of surgery ▪ If the patient is in DCF custody, arrange for anesthesia consent via phone in advance of surgery ▪ Obtain a copy of guardianship papers, if applicable ◦ Refer to MOLST entry, if applicable ◦ Review pre-op guidelines with the facility NP, emphasizing: ▪ The facility will need to call BCH for the OR time ▪ Discontinue NSAIDs pre-operatively ▪ Which medications to take vs. hold prior to surgery ◦ Document the following information in the PAEF Special Needs section: ▪ Mode of transportation to BCH on DOS (e.g. ambulance, van, private car) ▪ Equipment needed upon arrival to BCH on DOS (e.g. stretcher, wheelchair, Hoyer lift) ▪ Precautions ▪ Trach/vent/O2 dependence ▪ Custody status (e.g. DCF) ◦ Note the pre-op visit and/or day of surgery in the Perioperative Care Coordination Clinic Charge RN calendar ▪ If the patient is coming to the PCCC, they will be fast-tracked to minimize the wait time ◦ Provide the facility with the following documents: ▪ ""Checklist for Transfer of Patients from Facilities"" (see end of document) ▪ This should be completed by the facility and accompany the patient to BCH on the DOS ▪ Brochure with printed NPO guidelines ▪ Documents should be handed to staff at the pre-op visit or faxed to the facility if the patient is SDWU • Additional considerations ◦ Most facility patients are very complex, so it is ideal if the same RN/NP who completes the PAEF also performs the SDWU phone assessment or in-person pre-op visit ◦ If the care coordination RN/NP delegates follow-up tasks to a colleague, s/he should clearly document the plan ◦ Arrival time on the day of surgery is typically one hour pre-operatively in order to minimize wait time • Local residential facilities ◦ Franciscan Children's Hospital ◦ Seven Hills • Forms at the end of this document ◦ Patient Navigation Tool ◦ Checklist for Transfer of Patients from Facilities","Sleep logs and ideally actigraphy may be obtained for 1 week prior to the MSLT to assess sleep-wake schedules. The patient's clothing should be comfortable, be appropriate to the environment, and not interfere with the performance of tests. A change in clothing is not required between the PSG and MSLT. The proceeding nocturnal PSG must allow a minimum 7 hours of time in bed with at least 6 hours of sleep, with timing that corresponds with the patient's major sleep period. The test should not be performed after a night during which PAP pressures were adjusted (split-night or PAP titration study). Patients on PAP/non-PAP therapies for sleep-disordered breathing should use them during the PSG and MSLT. The PAP settings and mask interface should match those used at home The patient should abstain from alcohol, caffeine, marijuana, and other sedating or alerting agents on the day of the test. Nicotine use is discouraged but if unavoidable should be terminated at least 30 minutes before a nap trial. Stimulating activities such as the use of electronic devices and the use of cell phones should end at least 30 minutes before each nap trial. Vigorous physical activity and prolonged exposure to sunlight/bright artificial light should be avoided all day. Standardization of test conditions is critical for obtaining valid results. Sleep rooms should be dark and quiet during testing. Room temperature should be set for the patient's comfort level. A light breakfast at least 1 hour before the first trial and a light lunch immediately after the termination of the second nap trial are recommended. Routine drug screening is recommended to ensure that sleepiness on the MSLT is not pharmacologically induced. Drug screening is usually performed on the morning of the MSLT but its timing and the circumstances of the testing may be modified by the clinician. Patient paperwork should include documentation of medications the patient is taking (dose and time taken), medications recently discontinued (what and when), habitual bedtime and wake time, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Instruct patient to complete the MSLT questionnaire after each nap (do you think you fell asleep/ dreamt) Sleep technologists who perform MSLT should be experienced in conducting the test. Stimulants, stimulant-like medications, and REM suppressing medications should ideally be stopped two weeks before MSLT. Use of the patient's other usual medications should be thoughtfully planned by the sleep clinician before MSLT testing so that undesired influences by the stimulating or sedating properties of the medications are minimized. Drug screening may be indicated to ensure that sleepiness on the MSLT is not pharmacologically induced. Drug screening is usually performed on the morning of the MSLT but its timing and the circumstances of the testing may be modified by the clinician. Deviations from ideal testing times and conditions (e.g, caffeine, nicotine, napping, cell phone, fire alarms, or other stimulating activities) should be documented by the sleep technologist.

What system is utilized for electronic submission of protocols and how does it provide information to IRB members for review,0,"New research protocol applications that do not meet the criteria for exemption or expedited review are placed on the agenda for convened IRB review. Protocols are discussed on an individual basis. 1. All protocols are submitted electronically and made available to IRB members through the CHeRP system. a. All IRB members have full access to the complete submission under review. b. The electronic submission utilizes a series of SmartForms that request specific information for all protocols (e.g. research team, financial disclosure, funding information) and then branch to other forms as necessary for the category of research under consideration. i. Document uploads are in multiple sections of the SmartForms where the research team can provide complete information required for IRB review.","All research involving intervention or interaction with human subjects that is submitted to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) must undergo scientific review at the department or division level prior to IRB review. Some departments may opt to require scientific review for non-interventional studies as well. Responsibility for scientific review rests with each department or division. Departments and divisions are responsible for developing their own mechanism for assuring appropriate scientific review and establishing an explicit and formal process of scientific review that assesses and evaluates the scientific merit, complexity, and potential risks of each research protocol, before that protocol is submitted to the IRB for review. In order to assure that scientific review occurs prior to IRB submission review, the IRB protocol application cannot be submitted to the IRB until scientific review and approval are documented as complete. This process is automated by the CHeRP (Children's Hospital Electronic Research Portal) protocol submission system. The IRB requires that any scientific review correspondence (e.g. questions and responses, letters of final approval) be submitted as part of the protocol application. This information often facilitates IRB deliberations and may expedite the review process. The IRB reserves the right to review and comment on the scientific review process as it relates to human subjects protection. If the IRB identifies areas of significant scientific concern, these issues are referred to the Chair or Division Chief for reconsideration at the scientific review level.","All new protocols are assigned a primary and a secondary reviewer. The primary and secondary reviewers are responsible for a complete review and summary of the protocol application. 1. Expertise: At least one of the two reviewers must have the appropriate expertise to review the topic of the protocol. If there is not appropriate expertise: a. either an outside consultant will be sought, or b. the protocol will be rescheduled for review when expertise is obtained. 2. Convened IRB presentation: The primary and secondary reviewers present the protocol to the IRB at a convened meeting. a. The primary reviewer presents a brief summary of the protocol, followed by their comments. b. The secondary reviewer presents their comments only. c. Following presentation by the primary and secondary reviewer, the IRB is invited to provide additional comments. i. All members are asked to review all protocols and informed consents in preparation for the discussion. 3. Primary and secondary reviewers receive a Reviewer Worksheet that must be completed and uploaded in IRB electronic system prior to IRB meeting. a. The use of this worksheet is mandatory. b. The worksheet guides the reviewer comments and is structured to discuss the issues within the context of the regulatory criteria. c. The worksheet requires that reviewers consider all the regulatory criteria required for approval.","IRB administrators initially determine whether the protocol meets the criteria for expedited review as specified by the regulations, which include the applicability criteria. 1. It is important to recognize that procedures that may be considered minimal risk in adults may not be minimal risk in children. This may be the result of psychological or emotional distress, even if the actual procedures present minimal physical risk to the subject. 2. The standard requirements for informed consent (or its waiver, alteration, or exception) apply. IRB Chair/Vice Chair Review After initial screening by the IRB administrative staff and the pre-review, the protocols are brought to the attention of the IRB Chair or Vice Chairs. The Chair or Vice Chairs will: 1. Review the protocol. 2. Any IRB member may be asked to serve as an expedited reviewer as required, based on their experience and length of service. 3. Designate an experienced IRB member to provide review. a. IRB Chairs may designate themselves to perform the review. b. The IRB Chair/Vice Chair will consider: i. The discipline of the research protocol and expertise of members ii. Length of the IRB member's service c. IRB members are asked to declare conflict of interest (COI) for any protocol they are asked to review through expedited review procedures. i. No member with a COI may serve as a reviewer for any expedited item. ii. If there is a COI, the protocol will be reassigned. d. If a protocol involves prisoners and is eligible for expedited review, the prisoner representative will be one of the designated expedited reviewers. e. The IRB Chair/Vice Chairs may also refer any protocol to the full committee for review at a convened meeting. i.

Research activity may be disapproved only after review in accordance with the non-expedited procedures. A list including the protocol titles, PIs, protocol numbers, and designated expedited review categories is sent to the full committee at its next scheduled meeting.","1. Is it possible to voluntarily submit data to the NIH GWAS Repository? Yes. The NIH is hoping that even when the policy is not triggered, investigators will voluntarily share their data. If an investigator voluntarily submits data to GWAS – the submission must be in compliance with the GWAS Policy. 2. How do you submit materials for the open-access portion of the Repository? Unless otherwise described in the grant announcement, these materials (The protocol, questionnaires, variables measured and other supporting documentation) should be submitted at the same time the genotype/phenotype information is submitted to the controlled access portion. Specific instructions will be part of the grant instructions. 3. Who is responsible for submitting data to the NIH GWAS Repository? The person/entity who is receiving the NIH funds for the GWAS analyses is responsible for submitting the data. For multi-institution research, the single submitting person/center is responsible for ascertaining the compliance of all centers. 4. How do you submit coded genotype-phenotype data to the NIH GWAS Repository? a. Each submission must include a letter of certification signed by the Institutional Official. This letter certifies that the IRB has reviewed and verified the following: i. That the submission of the data is consistent with the informed consent form of study participants from whom the data was initially obtained ii. That the de-identification of the data sets is consistent with the GWAS standards (HIPAA standards) iii. That the risks to individuals, their families and groups or populations associated with the data submitted has been considered and iv. That the genotype and phenotype data to be submitted were collected in a manner consistent with the Common Rule (federal law re: human research protections) b. The submitting investigator must provide the following documents to the IRB: i. Description of what genotype/phenotype data is being submitted to the NIH GWAS Repository ii. Copy of the consent form/s used to collect the initial data/samples NOTE : This must include forms from all sites. iii. Description of the method/s used for coding the data iv. Description of how the link will be maintained with assertion that it will never be shared with the NIH. v. NIH ID# of the grant 5. Is there a specific 'certification' form that you should use for submission of genotype/phenotype data into the NIH GWAS Repository? Yes. Children's Hospital has developed language for a certification letter to be signed by the Vice President, Research Administration. Before signing the required form, the Vice President will want to know that that the IRB has made the required determinations. Please contact the IRB office to discuss the submission of data. When review is completed, the certification letter with institutional signature will be sent to the PI for submission to NIH. 6. What happens if the IRB determines that the initial consent forms are not consistent with submission of data to the NIH GWAS Repository? The data cannot be submitted. The only way to submit the data would be if study participants were re- contacted and re-consented. a. Re-consent requires submission of an amendment to the IRB. The IRB would have to consider whether re-contact and re-consent is feasible and/or appropriate. b. NIH has said that investigators can request funds to cover the expense of re-consenting. 7. What if study participants cannot be re-contacted for a new consent? At this time, the NIH will not accept data without an IRB approved consent form. 8. What if the initial consent form included language consistent with sharing genetic data with the NIH but limited the research to a single disease/condition? The IRB can determine that the data can be submitted – but that the NIH GWAS Repository can only make the data available for that restricted use. 9. What if the original data and tissue were collected under a waiver of consent? At this time, the NIH will not accept data that was obtained without informed consent and a form documenting that consent.",3,4,1,3,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1

When should focused patientfamily education on the ERAS protocol be provided according to the hospital policies,0,"Many surgeons now utilize service-specific ERAS protocols. According to the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists (n.d.),: Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS ® ) refers to patient-centered, evidence-based, multidisciplinary team developed pathways for a surgical specialty and facility culture to reduce the patient's surgical stress response, optimize their physiologic function, and facilitate recovery. These care pathways form an integrated continuum, as the patient moves from home through the pre-hospital / preadmission, preoperative, intraoperative, andpostoperative phases of surgery and home again. Depending on the timing of a patient's pre-op visits, the family may not be aware of the ERAS protocol prior to the PCCC visit or SDWU call. Consequently, they will require focused patient-family education during the pre- op visit or phone call.","• ERAS protocols exist for the following procedures: ◦ ACL IT Band ◦ Abdominal Surgery ◦ Bladder Exstrophy ◦ PAO ◦ Orthognathic Procedures with OMFS Team ◦ Gender Affirming Chest Reconstructive Surgery ◦ Reduction Mammoplasty (not for Dr. Ganke's patients as of 9/19/22) • ERAS should be noted on the OR booking sheet ◦ If ERAS is NOT noted on the OR booking sheet, contact the surgeon and/or associated PA/NP to confirm if the patient will be on the ERAS protocol • To access a surgical service's ERAS protocol, follow the steps below: ◦ BCH Homepage > Departments & Programs > Anesthesiology, Critical Care and Pain Medicine > Clinical Guidelines & Policies > Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) • During care coordination, RN/NP staff should: ◦ Note ""ERAS"" in the following sections of the PAEF: ▪ Special Needs ▪ Anesthesia Pre-Op Discussion ▪ Nursing Communication ◦ Print a copy of the appropriate service-specific ERAS protocol and place it in the patient's paper chart for review at the pre-op visit • During the pre-op visit/phone call, the RN/NP should: ◦ Review the pre-op portion of the ERAS protocol ◦ Refer the family to the surgeon and/or anesthesiologist for additional questions related to ERAS","The protocol application and informed consent should describe in detail: 1.

Who is responsible for coordinating the chemical inventory reconciliation process on hazardous materials used andor stored in the lab,0,"All laboratories, procedure rooms, and chemical storage areas must complete an annual inventory of hazardous chemicals and compressed gases. Note: Hazardous materials are any liquid or solid chemical that has a hazard rating assigned to it, as well as compressed gasses and liquid nitrogen. On an annual basis, the Environmental Health & Safety Department coordinates the chemical inventory reconciliation process on all hazardous materials used and/or stored in the lab to: • ensure the safety of all occupants of the facility by providing information and/or hazard warnings to employees entering or working in a laboratory, • provide an appropriate alert for the protection of public and private emergency response personnel, and • assist in planning for effective fire and emergency control operations. All areas that store and use hazardous chemicals and compressed gases are required by the Environmental Health and Safety Department to keep an updated chemical inventory or obtain a copy from the Chemical Inventory web page.",EH&S maintains the inventory of hazardous chemicals used within the organization through a annual reconciliation process. Completed chemical inventories are posted online within the EH&S internal web page. It is the responsibility of the Department Manager or PI to inform EH&S if an area requires a chemical inventory upon identification of the area. The responsibility of determining whether a chemical is hazardous lies with the chemical manufacturer or importer. Employees may rely on the evaluation received from these suppliers through labels on containers and SDS that are received with materials shipments.,"The Chemical Inventory Reconciliation is performed annually, on behalf of the organization, by the Environmental Health and Safety Department. Hazardous Materials storage locations captured within the CISPro electronic chemical inventory program are located within the Enders, Karp, CLS, Fegan, Farley, Hunnewell, Bader, Pavillion, Waltham, Lexington and Peabody locations. Hazardous materials are ordered throughout the year by various areas using a specific approval code within PeopleSoft. These orders are reviewed by the Environmental Health & Safety Department to assure users have the appropriate use and storage locations, waste disposal facilities, training, and other relevant chemical safety parameters before the material is ordered by the supply chain purchase agent. Approved materials are entered into the CISPro database to enable supply chain the ability to create location/bottle specific bar codes which instantaneously updates the chemical inventory upon arrival of the material. Employees are required to remove the CISPro bar codes from chemical containers and affix them to the posted disposal sheets within the laboratory. Environmental Health & Safety provides new disposal bar code sheets within the laboratory, scans discarded bar codes, and updates the system. When a new chemical is introduced or an old chemical is removed that will change the NFPA rating for the room, the Environmental Health and Safety Department adjusts the hazard ratings and updates the NFPA 704 Diamond sign. Completing a Manual Chemical Inventory The process noted below is to be performed by hazardous material users not currently captured within the CISPro inventory program. For example, laboratories moving in after the annual reconciliation, new offsite locations, previously existing spaces now requiring hazardous materials, etc How To Determine if a Chemical is Hazardous Hazard ratings can be found on the chemical label and may appear in numerical form as in the 704 Diamond, or in image form or text form. Information to Include on the Chemical Inventory The chemical inventory should be done in an Excel spreadsheet provided by the Environmental Health and Safety Department. The spreadsheet must include: • Principal Investigator (P.I.), laboratory representative and emergency contact names and off-hours phone number (i.e. home or cell phone number) • Location of where the chemical is kept (i.e. room number, bay number, or flammable cabinet) • Chemical name • CAS # (Chemical Abstract System number) • Physical state (solid or liquid) • New quantity • Brand (i.e. Aldrich, Sigma, VWR) • Any NFPA information if known from MSDSs For Principal Investigators that have more than one laboratory location, a spreadsheet needs to be submitted for each laboratory location, for proper room hazard designation. Example Spreadsheet Set-up: Chemicals have a way of turning up in the least likely locations and therefore, to perform an accurate and complete inventory of the lab, all cabinets, shelves, corners and cubbies must be checked! Take this opportunity to discard any old, out of date or no longer used chemicals. Label these chemicals with a Hazardous Waste label, place them in the Satellite Accumulation Areas and submit a Hazardous Waste Pick-up Request Form . Note: If you discover a chemical that does not look as it should or a container that does not appear to be intact, DO NOT MOVE THE CHEMICAL. Call ext 5-3499; briefly describe the situation, and ask to have the Safety-on-Call person paged. Submitting the Chemical Inventory Spreadsheet Forward the completed Chemical Inventory spreadsheet as an email attachment to the Environmental Health and Safety Department. What will the Chemical Inventories be used for? Environmental Health and Safety will use these inventories to identify the hazard level of each laboratory in the Enders Facility and will update the 704 Diamond sign located on every entrance door to a lab. Copies of the completed inventories will be placed with security for easy access in an emergency. Additionally, any ""4"" ratings will be highlighted for quick reference in an emergency situation. There may be some instances where the label does not identify the contents as hazardous. In this case, refer to the Material Safety Data Sheet for the specific chemical information. MSDS's are available online from the Children's Hospital internal home page; click the "" Material Safety Data Sheets "" link.","The accumulation, storage and handling of hazardous chemical wastes in laboratories is regulated by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, code 310 CMR 30.00 and enforced by MADEP. All Boston Children's laboratories or additional accumulation areas must comply with these regulations. Waste collected in the laboratory must be gathered in a Satellite Accumulation Area. The Principal Investigator, clinical department director or his/her designee is responsible for monitoring, controlling and maintaining compliance of the hazardous and/or toxic waste generated in the laboratory. In addition, laboratories must follow these Satellite Accumulation Area guidelines: • Store waste at or near the point of generation. Waste generated in lab 'xyz' must be stored in lab 'xyz', not moved across the hall to lab 'abc' The preferred location is within the fume hood at the waste generation point. If the waste is flammable, ignition sources must not be present in the hood. Alternate locations include under the hood, or in a flammable materials storage cabinet. • Designate the waste collection area with a sign reading ""HAZARDOUS WASTE Satellite Accumulation Area."" The Environmental Health & Safety Department, at (617) 355-8100 (Internal: 5-8100), provides these signs. • Select containers that are compatible with the waste stream (e.g., will not react with the waste). Be sure all containers are in good condition. • Store only one container per waste stream at any time. Use chemical compatibility charts posted at the Satellite Accumulation Area. • Keep containers closed at all times except when adding material in to the container. Remove funnels and replace the lid when done adding waste. • Keep waste containers separate from working stock and virgin chemicals. Hazardous Waste Satellite Accumulation Area containment bins are for waste containers only. • Store the waste in an area where the Principal Investigator (PI) or person-in-charge can inspect the container from all angles to be sure that it is not leaking . The PI or designee must inspect the Satellite Accumulation Area each week to check container integrity, Hazardous Waste label information, and amount of waste. • Store waste containers in containment trays. Store incompatible waste streams in separate secondary containment trays. • Label each container with a Hazardous Waste label as soon as waste collection begins . Include the following information: ◦ Type of hazard associated with waste (e.g. ignitable). ◦ Name of chemical(s)—do not abbreviate or use chemical formulas; spell out entire chemical name. ◦ Hazardous and/or toxic waste labels are available from the Research Laboratory Support Office located in Enders 030 and from the Environmental Health & Safety Department. • Add the date to the Hazardous Waste label when the container is full. • Place discarded, unused/out of date chemicals in the Satellite Accumulation Area for pick-up. Label and Date the container as noted above . Do not remove or obstruct the manufacturer's label with the Hazardous Waste label. • Leave unused chemicals in their original container. • Complete a Hazardous Waste Pick-Up Request Form on-line or call ext 5-8100 immediately when the container is full or the laboratory stops generating that waste stream . Regulations require that these containers be moved to the facility's hazardous waste storage area within three (3) days. If you are creating a new Satellite Accumulation Area, page the Safety Officer on-Call (7233 [SAFE]). EH&S will provide the needed equipment such as signs, labels, containment trays, bottles, etc. Place a hazardous waste pick-up request for a laminated copy of the Chemical Waste Satellite Accumulation Guidelines.","Work Practice Guidelines • Only persons trained to work with highly hazardous and/or toxic chemicals, including select carcinogens can handle such chemicals. • Wear the appropriate personnel protective equipment as outlined in the standard laboratory attire protocol. • Use the smallest amount of the chemical consistent with requirements for a given procedure. • Use high efficiency hydrophobic filters to protect vacuum lines and pumps from contamination. • Store high hazard chemicals as outlined in the Safe Handling and Storage of Hazardous Material chapter of this manual. • Prepare and dispose of wastes as outlined in the Safety Manual: Hazardous Waste Management Plan chapter. Designated Area Guidelines • Designate areas for work with highly hazardous and/or toxic chemicals, including select carcinogens and confine work to that area. • Designated areas may be an appropriate chemical fume hood, downdraft table, glove box, and lab bench or lab quadrant. • Designated areas are to be posted with their boundaries clearly marked by signs or other visible means of identification such as hazard tape. • Designated areas can be changed as the inventory and use changes. • Designated areas must be decontaminated when work is completed.",1,4,1,3,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1

Solid enteral medications are verified using the product codes imprinted on the tablets, capsules or manufacturer unit-dose packaging, tablet/capsule shape and color. 2. The integrity of the product is also evaluated by a pharmacist. 3. Liquid medications, parenteral medications and bulk-packaged powder medications cannot be verified and therefore, cannot be administered unless allowance is expressly written by the prescriber in the patient's chart. However, the pharmacy may help determine the concentration from the label when possible and contact the preparing pharmacy if requested by the clinical team. Additionally the pharmacist reviews the medication from home for potential problems such as mislabeling, inconsistency between the hospital order and the home medication, and other discrepancies. A label containing a patient specific barcode may then be affixed to the product by the pharmacy to assist with BCMA and nursing documentation of administered doses. This label does not confer verification of contents beyond the extrapolated substance and concentration as stated above. 4. The pharmacist alerts the nurse if the home medication cannot be returned to the floor in the usual turnaround time frame of 60 minutes. 5. Virtual verification may be employed for situations such as, but not limited to, precaution rooms or during infectious disease epidemics/pandemics.

Do not infuse medications if the UVC is in the liver. In this case, the line is removed. 3. Umbilical vessel catheters require a continuous infusion via an infusion pump. Heparin infusion is recommended for UAC and may be indicated for UVC to decrease the incidence of thrombotic complications. The solution typically contains 1 unit heparin/mL of infusion fluid. 4. Blood products may be administered via a UVC but administration via a UAC is restricted to when no other access is available, due to risk of clot formation. 5. Glucose containing solutions may be given via UVC or high lying UAC. Specific maximal glucose infusion rates may be determined by manufacturer's recommendations. In general, a maximal dextrose concentration should not exceed 30% via UVC and 20% via UAC. 6. Hypertonic solutions increase the risk of vascular perforation and arterial spasms. Glucose administration via a malpositioned UAC may cause refractory hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulinemia resulting from infusion of glucose into pancreatic artery. 7. Medications may be administered via the UVC. If additional access is limited, medications may be administered via the UAC with some restrictions. Medications that are irritating or hyperosmolar can be damaging to the aorta. The following medications are not infused via a UAC : a. Calcium gluconate or calcium chloride due to risk of intestinal bleeding and lower extremity tissue necrosis b. Indomethacin/ Ibuprofen due to risk of altered blood flow to the mesenteric arteries c. Phenobarbital d. Phenytoin e. Sodium bicarbonate due to risk of rapid alterations in pH which may cause arterial spasm; may be slowly infused through the UVC f. Vasoactive medications including Epinephrine, Dopamine and Dobutamine. 8. Enteral feedings may be initiated in patients with an indwelling UVC or a high positioned UAC.

What is the process for determining the credibility of an allegation of research misconduct and who is involved in making this determination,0,"BCH is committed to fostering a research environment that promotes responsible research practices in compliance with regulatory and institutional requirements, and to helping prevent Research Misconduct. Covered individuals have an obligation to report allegations of research misconduct and to provide evidence to the RIO. Allegations should be specific. Individuals should not discuss the allegation(s) with others prior to discussion with the RIO. BCH will respond to each Allegation in a thorough, competent, objective, and fair manner, and will take reasonable steps to conduct an impartial and unbiased Research Misconduct proceeding. Individuals are required to inform the RIO immediately of any attempted violation of procedural integrity, or any breach of confidentiality or privacy. The RIO will address any concerns regarding personal, professional, of financial conflict of interest among individuals involved in the proceeding. A. Non-Retaliation Through the RIO, BCH will take all reasonable and practical steps to protect good faith Complainants , witnesses, and panel members, their positions and reputations, and counter potential or actual retaliation against them. B. Confidentiality and Privacy To the extent feasible, all individuals involved in a Research Misconduct proceeding shall make diligent efforts to limit disclosure of information only to those who have a need to know, in order to minimize damage to the reputation of individuals, protect the confidentiality of the Respondent and Complainant, and of research records or evidence from which research subjects might be identified. The RIO can, at his/her discretion, communicate any aspect of the matter covered by this Policy with other agencies, departments, and offices whose jurisdiction or interests are implicated by the alleged misconduct and take necessary actions to protect the scientific integrity of the project. C. Cooperation Individuals involved in a Research Misconduct proceeding are expected to fully participate and cooperate in good faith. Obstruction of any aspect of the proceeding may itself constitute evidence of Research Misconduct. Obstruction includes intentionally withholding or destroying evidence in violation of a duty to disclose or preserve; falsifying evidence; encouraging, soliciting, or giving false testimony; and attempting to intimidate witnesses, potential witnesses, or potential leads to witnesses or evidence. D. Coordination with Other Academic Institutions Harvard Medical School (""HMS"")- If the Respondent had an appointment as fellow or faculty at HMS at the time of the alleged Research Misconduct, the RIO shall confer and discuss the logistics of joint review with HMS. The RIO, following consultation with the Compliance Department, may choose to delegate any or all of the functions described in the Policy to HMS, for resolution according to the ""Principles and Procedures for Dealing with Allegations of Faculty Misconduct."" The decision of whether to delegate and what policy is applicable shall be made in accordance with the following criteria and conditions: a. Substantial involvement of full-time Harvard faculty or fellow as co-investigators in a research project; b. Substantial involvement of investigators from Harvard-affiliated hospitals other than the BCH in a research project; c. Substantial involvement of Harvard students in a research project; d. Involvement of BCH medical staff so senior as to call into question ability of BCH-specific processes to be fair and neutral; and e. Funding by HMS or HMS is the primary site receiving sponsored funds. BCH shall retain jurisdiction over part or all proceedings and apply this Policy when the following conditions are present: a. All significant witnesses and all Respondents are employees of or otherwise directly affiliated with BCH; b. BCH personnel have subject matter expertise and availability to undertake fact-finding in regard to the subject matter of the Allegations; c. When other institutions' personnel are involved, the other institutions' RIOs express a preference for BCH' s process as opposed to HMS' s process and agree to full cooperation with the BCH process; and d. Funding by BCH for the research or BCH is the primary site receiving funds. Howard Hughes Medical Institute (""HHMI"")- If the Respondent is an employee of HHMI at the time of the alleged Research Misconduct, RIOs will jointly decide whether BCH will apply this Policy or whether the HMS or HHMI Policy on Research Misconduct will apply. Other Institutions- If the Respondent is an employee at other non-Harvard-affiliated institution at the time of the alleged Research Misconduct, the RIO shall coordinate further review with the other institution. RIOs at impacted institutions jointly determine which institution will bear primary responsibility. BCH is committed to sharing of information and keeping other institutions informed as to the proceedings, where the interest of both BCH and other institutions are significantly impacted.","Disciplinary action may be taken against a house staff member for due cause, including but not limited to any of the following: • Professional misconduct or conduct that might be inconsistent with or harmful to good patient care or safety, • Conduct detrimental to the reputation or standing of the Hospital; • Conduct which calls into question the integrity, ethics, or judgment of the house staff member or which could prove detrimental to the Hospital's employees, staff, volunteers, patients, visitors, or operations; • Violation of the bylaws, rules, regulations, policies, or procedures of the medical staff, Hospital, or applicable department, division, or training program; Any allegation of misconduct in science or research involving a house staff member shall be addressed and resolved in accordance with Hospital policy.","The consequences of the Significant Risk (SR) and Non-Significant Risk (NSR) determination are very important, and the regulatory responsibilities for sponsors and investigators of SR and NSR risk studies differ. The major regulatory differences between the two concern: 1. The approval processes. 2. The record keeping and reporting requirements. Significant Risk Device Studies SR device studies, before the study can begin an IDE application must be first submitted and approved by the FDA. If the IRB believes that a study is an SR device study, the investigation may not begin until both the IRB and the FDA approve the study Non-Significant Risk Device Studies Most notably, sponsors (or sponsor-investigators) of NSR device studies do not need to submit an IDE application to FDA; the IRB serves as the FDA's surrogate for review, approval, and continuing review of the NSR device studies. Additionally, for NSR device studies there are abbreviated regulatory sponsor responsibilities (e.g. labeling, IRB, consent, monitoring, reporting, prohibition on promotion). The SR/NSR decision is also of consequence to the FDA because the IRB serves, in a sense, as the FDA's surrogate with respect to the review and approval of NSR studies. 1. Sponsors are responsible for making the initial risk determination and presenting it to the IRB. 2. The FDA is available to help the sponsor, clinical investigator, and IRB in making the risk determination. 3. Sponsors/Investigators are encouraged to review the FDA Information Sheet: Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies for determining risk. If an investigator or a sponsor proposes to the IRB to undertake an NSR investigation, the IRB must make a separate and independent determination that the study is, in fact, an NSR device study. The IRB's determination that a device is an NSR device must be documented in the Convened IRB's minutes.","1. If an investigator seeks a waiver of informed consent, the section of the protocol application that requires a justification of the means by which the waiver criteria are met for that study must be completed. 2. If a protocol is eligible for expedited review, the expedited reviewer is responsible for determining that the criteria are met prior to accepting a waiver. If the protocol is not eligible for expedited, the IRB is reviewer is responsible for determining that the criteria are met prior to accepting a waiver. 3. If the IRB or expedited reviewer agrees with the determinations and findings provided by the investigator in the application form, the agreement will be documented in the IRB minutes or if through the expedited review in the protocol record. 4. In making a determination as to whether the research could not be practicably carried out without the waiver or alteration, the IRB or expedited reviewer will consider the following criteria: a. The size of the population being researched b. The proportion of individuals likely to have relocated or died since the time the personal information was originally collected or the patient was seen for clinical care. c. The risk of introducing potential bias into the research, thereby affecting the generalizability and validity of the results. d. The risk of creating additional threats to privacy by having to link otherwise de-identified data with nominal identifiers in order to contact individuals to seek their consent. e. The risk of inflicting psychological, social or other harm by contacting individuals or families with particular conditions or in certain circumstances. f. The difficulty and loss of privacy inherent in contacting individuals directly when there is no existing relationship between the organization and the individuals. g. The difficulty of contacting individuals indirectly through public means, such as advertisements and notices. h. Whether, in any of the above circumstances, the requirement for additional financial, material, human, organizational and other resources needed to obtain such consent will make the conduct of the research impracticable because it is an undue hardship. i. If the IRB or Expedited Reviewer agrees, the minutes and/or determination letter must document concurrence or the IRB's determination.","1. Investigators are responsible, on a per protocol basis, for designating appropriate individuals to obtain consent for a protocol. It is also the investigator's responsibility to train, oversee, and monitor all individuals who obtain consent on his or her protocol. 2. Individuals other than the investigator may obtain consent; however, any individual who obtains consent must be listed on the protocol application as having this role. 3. Only members of the research team who have experience in all elements of the study may provide a complete and accurate description of the research, and answer questions and concerns. 4. Even when responsibilities for obtaining informed consent are delegated, the investigator always remains responsible for assuring an adequate process to obtain informed consent. Special considerations include the technicality of the details of the protocol, and who can best explain them. For example, research that involves the use of an investigational drug will likely require that a physician member of the research team obtain informed consent. 5. Who is best able to answer the questions that may come up? It may be advantageous to have two individuals involved in the consent process. 6. Often the investigator provides information, and a research nurse is made available to follow-up and provide additional information. 7. If an individual other than the investigator is obtaining consent, is the investigator available if questions arise? Who can spend as much time with the families as they require. If an investigator is also the family's physician, can the family distinguish the different roles?",3,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
What is the process for requesting time off to observe a religious holiday according to hospital policy,0,"• Non-Exempt Employees are eligible for Holiday Pay for all time worked on an Observed Holiday. Holiday Pay is paid at a rate of one-and-a-half times the Non-Exempt Employee's base hourly rate. • Exempt Plus Employees are eligible for Holiday Pay as a premium when working a shift on an Observed Holiday. Holiday Pay is paid for all hours in the shift at 50% of the Employee's Base Hourly Rate Equivalent and is in addition to the Employee's regular base salary. • When New Year's Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day or Christmas Day, fall on a Saturday or Sunday and BCH observes the Holiday on a Friday or a Monday. Holiday Pay is paid to eligible employees who work on January 1, June 19, July 4 or December 25, and is not paid for the Friday or Monday weekday observance. • Exempt Employees who are approved to work on an Observed Holiday are not eligible for Holiday Pay. • Full-time Exempt Employees who are in a salary plan that does not include Earned Time are paid their regular base salary on any Observed Holiday. • BCH will accommodate an Employee's request for time off to observe a religious holiday, unless the accommodation creates an undue hardship upon the conduct of business. Employees who believe they have been denied a religious accommodation to observe a religious holiday should contact the Employee Service Center.","• A reasonable religious accommodation for a sincerely held religious belief may include, but is not limited to: ◦ Time for prayer during a work day; ◦ the ability to attend religious events or observe a religious holiday; ◦ or, any necessary modification to a Boston Children's Hospital policy, procedure or other requirement for an employee's (or prospective employee's) religious beliefs, observance or practice provided such accommodation is reasonable and does not cause undue hardship. • Boston Children's Hospital will engage in an interactive process that may include exploring alternative accommodations that meet the employee's religious practice in the workplace. • A request for a religious accommodation may be denied if the accommodation would impose an undue hardship to Boston Children's Hospital. Some examples of factors to be considered in evaluating whether a proposed accommodation creates and undue hardship include, but are not limited to: ◦ The impact of the accommodation upon the operation of the department or facility, including the impact on the ability of other employees to perform their duties and the impact on the facility's ability to conduct business; ◦ Hospital operations, including the composition, structure and functions of its workforce; ◦ The nature and net cost of the accommodation needed; ◦ The overall financial resources of the department involved in the provision of the religious accommodation, the number of persons employed in that department, and the effect on expenses and resources; ◦ Accommodations that are disruptive, or that would fundamentally alter medical care and treatment requirements, the nature or operation of Boston Children's Hospital, or the essential functions of a job: and ◦ Accommodations which interfere with the safe and efficient operation of the workplace or with a bona fide seniority system will often present an undue hardship. • In cases where a determination of undue hardship is necessary, the Department head, in consultation with the Vice President for Human Resources or designee will make the assessment of undue hardship. • In addition to the essential functions identified in an employee's job document, depending on the particular circumstances of the position and the department, the following may be considered essential functions of the position: ◦ The ability to work a particular schedule or a certain number of hours; ◦ flexibility around scheduling; ◦ the ability to take call; the ability to work in a stressful, face paced environment; ◦ the ability to meet safety standards, including working safely and without significant risk of harm to patient, families, other employees or staff; ◦ the ability to follow procedures, protocols, policies, applicable regulations and/or work rules; and ◦ the ability to use a computer. • This list is non-exclusive and what is considered an essential function will vary from individual to individual. For all requests for religious accommodation, the determination of essential function is made on a case-by case basis. • Employees who are in need of a religious accommodation should inform their supervisor of the need for an accommodation. • A request for religious accommodation is a statement that an employee needs a work-related adjustment or change for a reason related to a sincerely held religious belief. The request must be made in writing using the Religious Accommodation Request Form . • Additional documentation in support of the request may be required. • Employees who anticipate being absent from work because of a religious observance must submit their request for time off in advance and as soon as they become aware of the need or at least ten (10) business days in advance. • The employee's request for a reasonable accommodation triggers an interactive process whereby the employee and Boston Children's Hospital engage in a dialogue about the possible options for reasonably accommodating the employee's religious needs. • Participants in the interactive process will generally include the employee, as well as the employee's supervisor(s), including the department head as necessary, representatives of the Human Resources Department, Employee Relations and the employee's spiritual leader as appropriate. • The employee must respond to reasonable request for information in a timely manner and must engage in the interactive process. • Participants in the interactive process will be provided information on a need-to know basis and appropriate measures will be taken to store and protect the employee's private religious information. • Religious accommodation requests will be evaluated through an interactive process and on a case-by- case basis taking into account the following considerations: ◦ analyzing the job requirements and identifying essential and non-essential job functions; ◦ identifying job-related limitations by consulting with the employee and by obtaining information from the employee; ◦ assessing the ability of the employee's ability to perform the essential functions of the position if the accommodation is granted. ◦ assessing information concerning the employee's work restrictions including the duration of the restriction; ◦ identifying possible reasonable religious accommodations; ◦ assessing whether the proposed religious accommodation poses an undue hardship or can be provided without requiring the elimination of an essential function(s) of the position; ◦ implementing and documenting the religious accommodation; and ◦ monitoring the effectiveness of the religious accommodation. • All participants in the interactive process are expected to work toward a timely resolution of the request for religious accommodation. • An employee or staff member's failure to comply and/or engage in the interactive process may result in Boston Children's Hospital denying the reasonable accommodation request. • Typically, a request for religious accommodation will be processed and resolved between 3 to 15 business days, depending upon the request and the availability of the relevant information. • Accommodations may change depending on the religious needs of the employee or staff member, any changes in the essential functions of the positon or needs of the Boston Children's Hospital. • An employee or staff member who needs additional accommodations or changes to existing accommodations should notify the employee or staff member's supervisor. • Job applicants who require religious accommodation to complete the hiring process should notify the Human Resources Department of the request. HR will work with the individual to respond to their needs. • All applicant requests for religious accommodation will be handled in a manner that is consistent with state and federal law and which ensures that qualified applicants of all faiths and creeds are not denied equal employment opportunities unless the religious accommodation could cause undue hardship on business operations. • Employees or job applicants who are dissatisfied with a decision regarding a request for religious accommodation may file a grievance under the Hospital's Grievance Review Policy. Alternatively, where appropriate, a complaint may be made under the Hospital's Sexual Harassment and Discrimination policy which has a process for the investigation of religious discrimination complaints.","• The employee must notify the manager of their need for a Leave of Absence, the expected duration of the leave being requested, and a return to work date as soon as the employee is able. Leave requests are processed through the Massachusetts Department of Family and Medical Leave and/or the Hospital's leave of absence and disability vendor. Refer to individual leave policies for detailed information about requesting time off. • Some leave/Time off requests will be approved or denied depending upon the operating needs of the Hospital, applicable law, policy eligibility and other relevant considerations. • Reasonable requests for time off will be granted. If, however, the request cannot be granted, the employee is expected to report to work. Employees who do not report for work or who take an unauthorized leave may be subject to disciplinary action or treated as having voluntarily resigned their employment. • Employees who believe that they may not have been provided with a leave protected by state or federal law, or who believe that they have been retaliated against for requesting a leave of absence, are encouraged to bring their concerns forward.","Summer Holidays (Memorial Day, 4th of July and Labor Day) Exempt Each weekend group (A, B, C) will be assigned a major summer holiday.

What steps should a nurse take if an infant does not pass the Newborn Hearing Screening test prior to discharge,1,"The MD/NP determines if the infant's hearing screen was completed at the birth hospital. If the infant has not had a hearing screening at the birth hospital or if the infant requires a repeat screen as determined by the guidelines in this policy, the medical team: • informs the parent/legal guardian of the significance of the hearing screenings. • contacts Audiology (ext 5-6461 or via Newborn Hearing Screen Request in EHR) to alert of the need for the screening prior to discharge. The Audiology Assistant performs the hearing screen. The Audiologist: • Reports normal results in patient chart (paper, if applicable, and in EHR) and communicates results to the parent/legal guardian. If the parent/legal guardian is not available, results are conveyed via telephone and/or postal mail. • Reports abnormal results to the medical team and to the parent/legal guardian, and documents results in the EHR. A member of the medical team and/or the audiologist discusses with the parent/legal guardian abnormal results, the result implications, and need for further testing. The Audiologist gives a list of DPH-approved diagnostic test centers to the parent/legal guardian and instructs him/her to make a follow-up diagnostic audiological evaluation appointment at an approved test center. If the infant does not pass the hearing test prior to discharge, the nurse documents that the follow-up appointment has been scheduled on the Newborn Hearing Screening Test Result form located in the ""consults"" section of the patient's chart. • If the follow-up appointment has not been scheduled, the nurse assists the parent/legal guardian with this process and documents the time and date of the appointment on the appropriate line of the form.","1. Massachusetts requires all newborns to receive a hearing screening by three months of age, unless the parent/guardian objects to a screen based on sincerely held religious beliefs 2. Hearing Screening must occur at the birth hospital before initial discharge to home or at a referring hospital (if the newborn is directly transferred from the birth hospital) before initially discharged to home a. BCH clinicians should obtain and document in the patient's chart information from the transferring hospital if a hearing screen was performed and the results of such screen. If the screen was not successful, missed, or the infant did not pass prior to the transfer, BCH shall conduct the screen prior to initial discharge to home. b. BCH clinicians must notify the parent(s)/guardian(s) both orally and in writing if a heaing screening was not successful, missed, or the infant did not pass. If a repeat or further screening cannot occur prior to discharge, the parent(s)/guardian(s) should be informed in writing of the inability to test prior to discharge, and the following should occur: i. Notify the infant's primary care provider; and ii. An appointment should be made at a DPH approved screening center such as BCH (note based on lack of availability of appointments at available locations, parents can also be provided with a list of sites that conduct such diagnostic screening for their choice). 3. If an infant cannot be screened due to delayed physiological development or physiological instability (related to but not limited to an illness or premature birth) as determined by the treating clinician, the infant shall be screened prior to discharge and as early as the identified physiological development or stability will permit reliable screening. 4. If the infant is discharged to home prior to conducting the hearing screen, an appointment is made for a screen to be performed within 1 month of the infants birth (note based on lack of availability of appointments at available locations, parents can also be provided with a list of sites that conduct such diagnostic screening for their choice). a. The infant's primary care provider should be notified that a hearing screen is pending. Re-screening 5. The Joint Committee on Infant Hearing (JCIH) recommends a repeat hearing screen prior to discharge for infants with conditions/complications associated with potential hearing loss. a. Conditions that warrant re-screening include, but are not limited to, history of ECMO, bilirubin level >20 and/or hyperbilirubinemia requiring an exchange transfusion, gentamicin dosing>72 hrs, furosemide>7 doses, culture-positive sepsis, and meningitis.","Complete patient care documentation as described in the Patient Care Manual.

What is the protocol for administering radiation to female patients age 12 and over,1,"The Radiology Departmental Policy is to inform all post-menarcheal and age 12 and older females and/or their parents/guardians that a pregnancy test will be performed prior to certain radiologic procedures that could be potentially harmful to a fetus. Menstrual status is determined in all female patients over the age of 11, being sensitive to the social, emotional, and cultural implications such an inquiry may have for certain young patients. All post-menarcheal patients and age 12 and older females undergoing radiologic procedures in which the dose to the fetus could potentially be >20 mGy (2 rad) should have a urine pregnancy test (HCG) at the time of the visit to confirm that the patient is not pregnant. If the patient cannot void spontaneously serum/plasma HCG is required. HCG's are valid for 48 hours. In Radiology, these procedures include, but are not limited to: • All interventional fluoroscopic procedures exposing the abdomen or pelvis • Diagnostic angiography of the abdomen or pelvis • Diagnostic CT examinations that include the abdomen or pelvis • PET/CT and SPECT/CT examinations that include diagnostic CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis • Other Nuclear Medicine studies include 67-Ga scans, I-131 scans, and Rest/Stress cardiac studies in excess of 30 millicuries. • All patients undergoing treatment with 131-I-radioiodine for thyroid cancer or 131-I MIBG for neuroblastoma/neuroendocrine tumor For procedures in which the dose to the fetus could potentially be >20 mGy (2 rad), verification of pregnancy status by clinical history may be sufficient for certain post menarcheal females who: • Have undergone oophorectomy • Have, by virtue of ongoing oncologic therapy (surgery/radiation/chemotherapy), and history attested they cannot possibly be pregnant • Who by virtue of prolonged inpatient status or clinical incapacity cannot reasonably be pregnant For these patients in whom clinical history is sufficient and pregnancy can be reliably excluded, the technologist will document the pregnancy status per the clinical history and may proceed with the exam. For patients being referred from the ED, please validate that they have ordered the HCG and have results before scanning the patient. For outpatients, obtain a urine sample for STAT pregnancy test and verify the test is negative. Results should be communicated to the Radiologist or Nuclear Medicine physician for inclusion in the diagnostic report.","• Before any radiation is administered to a female patient age 12 or over, the radiologic technologist will inquire if she could be pregnant. Refer to the following for more information: ◦ See the Family Education Sheet: Pregnancy Testing of Post-Menarcheal Female Patients at Children's Hospital .","The scope of the clinical imaging specialist assessment of patients before performing an imaging examination is as follows: 1. Actively verify the patient's identity according to the hospital's Patient Identification Policy and the Radiology Patient Identification Standard Operating Procedure . ◦ All patients must have a Boston Children's Hospital identification (ID) bracelet identifying the name, date of birth and medical record number of the patient. ◦ Before proceding with an imaging study or procedure, the technologist must verify patient identification using two unique identifiers and active verification. ◦ If the patient and/or parents/guardians have Limited English Proficiency or are non-English speaking, utilize Interpreter Services according to hospital policy (see Medical Interpreters ). 2. Actively verify that the Radiology order matches the patient's expectation for what procedures will be performed. 3. Identify the order as appropriate for the patient by reconciling the patient history with the history on the order and verify any special instructions entered by the ordering provider. When there is a discrepancy, the referring physician should be consulted for clarification. Documentation in the technical comments field in RADNET should reflect the clarification. 4. Determine menstrual status in all female patients over the age of 11 , acknowledging the social, emotional, and cultural implications such an inquiry may have for certain young patients. In all post-menarcheal and age 12 and older females, or their parents/guardians, inquire whether the patient may be pregnant (except US). If the potential for pregnancy cannot be reasonably excluded, verification by pregnancy testing should be considered. If a patient is pregnant, consult with the physician as to the necessity of the examination. A patient may only be radiographed in a life threatening situation or after an explanation of risks and benefits and signing consent to the examination. The patient should be shielded. 5. The Radiology Departmental Policy is to inform all post-menarcheal and age 12 and older females and/or their parents/guardians that a pregnancy test will be performed prior to radiologic procedures that could be potentially harmful to a fetus. In Radiology, these procedures include, but are not limited to: ◦ Interventional fluoroscopic procedures of the abdomen or pelvis ◦ Diagnostic angiography of the abdomen or pelvis ◦ Diagnostic CT examinations that include the abdomen or pelvis ◦ PET/CT and SPECT/CT examinations that include diagnostic CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis ◦ All patients undergoing treatment with 131-I-radioiodine for thyroid cancer 6. For certain examinations verification of pregnancy status by clinical history is sufficient. These include: ◦ Examinations that include the pelvis, but for which the dose to the fetus is estimated to be < 20 mGy (2 rad) include, but are not limited to: ◦ Murphy Hip CT, including extended FOV acquisitions extending to the iliac crest ◦ Non-contrast CT urogram (stone protocol) ◦ PET/CT or SPECT/CT exams that do not include diagnostic CT imaging of the abdomen or pelvis ◦ All routine diagnostic nuclear medicine examinations, except those listed above ◦ Many X-ray–based examinations may not directly expose the pelvis or a potentially gravid uterus to the x-ray beam. Nonetheless, because of the complex nature of the patients seen at BCH verification of pregnancy status by clinical history should still be obtained in post menarcheal females and females over the age of 12 years old undergoing routine X-ray exams 7.

Assess the patient's ability to be immobilized or positioned for the examination and make adjustments accordingly. Always inquire about issues/conditions that would impact the patients ability to cooperate or respond and act accordingly. 9. Verify allergies. If the patient has a latex allergy, follow the hospital's Care of Patients with Latex Allergies policy. 10. If a patient is found to have a previously undiagnosed infectious disease, notify the nurse taking care of the patient and inform Infectious Diseases. CF patients should not wait with other patients. ( Radiology Infection Control Policy ) 11. Verify the identity of the patient matched to the images before sending to SYNAPSE. Verify that the images have gone to SYNAPSE. 12. Escalate safety concerns using the chain of command before proceeding with the imaging examination.","• HCG testing is required for patients whose planned level of sedation is moderate or deep sedation. In accordance with the policy followed for general anesthesia, HCG testing will be performed on all female age 12 and over or after first menses, whichever occurs first. See Pregnancy Testing of Post-Menarcheal Female Patients for more information. ◦ If the targeted level of sedation is minimal sedation, no pregnancy testing is required, but all patients receiving any level of sedation should be counseled that sedation is contraindicated if pregnant.","This document provides departmental framework to guide the provision and planning of radiologic services for patients over the age of 21. The guideline recognizes that Boston Children's Hospital is a center for the diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases and possesses specialization in treatments and therapies unavailable at many medical centers. While Boston Children's Hospital has the treatment of pediatric patients as a core mission, through new and innovative therapies many more pediatric patients require care for pediatric disease extending into adulthood. Additionally, through Boston Children's Hospital's commitment to research and clinical innovation, the expertise, treatment, therapy, procedures and surgical care available at Boston Children's Hospital may not be available at an adult care facility. Accordingly, as a department, Radiology participates in the care of patients over the age of 21.

What are the considerations for Day Surgery DSU patients regarding bringing a Go Bag and home vent for use in PreOp Holding POH and PostAnesthesia Care Unit PACU,1,"The 32-bed PACU provides 24 hours per day/7 day per week post-anesthesia care to patients following the administration of anesthesia (general, regional or local with sedation) in conjunction with surgery or other diagnostic/therapeutic interventions. The unit offers a concentration of monitoring and resuscitation equipment and nursing personnel knowledgeable and skilled in its use. PACU nurses are responsible for safely caring for patients emerging from anesthesia, with attention to airway protection and hemodynamic monitoring. Vital signs, Aldrete scores and airway assessment are measured and recorded every 15 minutes for the first hour upon arrival. Pain assessment and control of nausea and vomiting are also an integral part of post-anesthesia care. PACU nurses collaborate closely with liaison nurses to reunite parent/family with patient to ensure family-centered care is prioritized. Nurses in PACU have a 1:2 patient ratio, though some patients require 1:1 or 2:1 care depending on acuity and complexity. We have one charge nurse that has oversight of the entire program each day. There are also nurses in lead roles that assist with communication and organization. POH 1, POH 2, DSU recovery and Mandell 3 have a lead nurse assigned. PACU Nurses are cross trained in POH, Liaison and Mandell 3 to allow for flexing to any area in periop when demand is needed. We work closely with clinical assistants in our area. During the busy daytime operations, we have one CA assigned to each of the following areas: POH 1, POH 2 and Liaison. We have 2-3 CA's working in PACU that can also flex to Mandell and the other areas as needed. The PACU is provided with medical staff coverage through the Department of Anesthesia for medical management of patients' post-anesthesia course.

The cardiac surgeon notifies the perfusion team of the need to perform plasmapheresis on bypass. 2. The cardiac surgeon or transplant cardiologist notifies the Blood Bank that plasmapheresis on CPB is needed. The desired plasma exchange volume is discussed with the Blood Bank (commonly 1-2x). Plasmapheresis on bypass requires 1 to 2 hours. The perfusionist should verify that the apheresis team will be in the operating room in time to set up and be ready to perform plasmapheresis at the initiation of bypass. 3. The Apheresis Team orders and administers the required blood products based on patient weight and plasmapheresis circuit size. While the bypass circuit does not contain the patient's plasma before bypass, that volume should still be used in the plasma volume calculation since the plasmapheresis system treats the entire circulating volume. The apheresis team will ask the perfusionist for the circuit prime volume before initiating the procedure. 4. The apheresis machine should be placed as close to the cardiotomy venous reservoir (CVR) as is practicable. 5. Plasmapheresis should be completed before aortic cross clamp removal. 6. The apheresis machine requires two luer connections to the bypass circuit. To note, flow rates through these connections will be less than 150 ml/min. a. The plasmapheresis supply line should be connected to the bypass venous line via a stopcock and oriented down if possible (and post KVAD if in use) to prevent possible air entrainment into the plasmapheresis circuit. b. The plasmapheresis return line should be connected to the cardiotomy and not the venous reservoir. c. The plasmapheresis return line may be connected to a secondary cardiotomy which drains to the primary cardiotomy if one is in use. d. The plasmapheresis line connections may require extensions (luered MUF circuit boot lines work well) including high flow stopcocks. 7. The plasmapheresis circuit may be primed with blood per standard procedure for the apheresis team. Patients less than 25 kg are more likely to receive an RBC prime of the plasmapheresis circuit. 8. The plasmapheresis circuit removes circulating heparin. The perfusionist will monitor ACTs during plasmapheresis to maintain an ACT ≥400 seconds. Heparin boluses will be given by the perfusionist PRN on bypass as per normal routine. 9. Plasma will be administered through the plasmapheresis machine while on bypass. The perfusionist administers calcium gluconate to balance the citrate load from the FFP. Calcium gluconate may be dosed empirically (250 mg/250 ml of apheresis replacement solution) or based on lab ionized calcium values. The patient must remain on bypass until the conclusion of plasmapheresis. Then, the plasmapheresis circuit volume may be processed through the cell saver. This usually yields approximately 100 ml of volume which will be transfused to the cardiotomy..","Note: Intermittent heparin flushing as described below is for patients >2kg.

The safety and efficacy of using the Actemra PFS diluted in IV bags as a solution for IV infusion has not been evaluated. Please refer to the locally approved product label for approved method of preparation and administration, important safety information, including Warnings, Precautions, and Contraindications. The risks and benefits of treatment as well as the potential health hazard of a formulation in a non-intended body compartment should be considered prior to initiating Actemra. We fully respect the clinical decisions and choices of healthcare providers and medical institutions. A surge of questions were received from health care providers across the globe on the unintended use of the Actemra PFS diluted in IV bags for IV infusion. To inform on the Actemra PFS diluted in IV bags for infusion, an in-use compatibility study was conducted to investigate the physicochemical stability of Actemra 162 mg solution in PFS with administration materials, including several commonly used IV bags, infusion line combinations with inline filters, and infusion pumps. 1 The in-use compatibility study procedures are summarized below: • Using aseptic technique, IV solutions were prepared by injecting Actemra PFS (162 mg/0.9 mL per single- dose) in 100 mL Sodium Chloride 0.9% IV bags. No saline solution was removed prior to injection. ◦ Two doses were tested. The low dose consisted of 1 PFS injected into a 100 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride bag, leading to a protein concentration of 1.6 mg/mL, corresponding to a dose of 162 mg. The high dose consisted of 6 PFS injected into a 100 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride bag leading to a concentration of 9.2 mg/mL corresponding to a dose of 972 mg. (Note: Actemra doses exceeding 800 mg per infusion are not recommended in rheumatoid arthritis or cytokine release syndrome patients.) • IV bags were prepared by inserting the needle of the syringe and pressing it firmly into the center of the septum of the IV bag at an 90-degree angle. The needle of Actemra PFS is ½ inch (i.e. 12.7 mm) and 26 gauge. • IV solutions were held at 30 ºC for 24 hours under diffused light. • Simulated infusions were conducted using administration sets with infusion line equipped with an inline filter and pumps (Baxter and Braun) capable of delivering the intended dose solution at ambient temperature under diffused light for a duration of 2 hours using an infusion rate of 19.6 mL/hr (infusion volume of 40 mL). • The administration materials included: ◦ Sodium Chloride 0.9% 100 mL IV bags with PVC, PO, PE, and PP as contact surface ◦ Administration sets with PE, PVC, PBD, and PUR as product contact surface ◦ Infusion aids (3-way stopcock) composed of PC ◦ Materials with ABS parts and silicone tubing ◦ IV cannulas/catheter on the infusion line made of PUR or Teflon (PTFE) ◦ 0.2 µm inline filters made of PES or PS • Compatibility of Actemra with other drugs and in-dwelling catheters, such as peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) and central venous access devices (CVADs), were not tested. Under the simulated preparation and administration conditions described above, no meaningful differences were observed in purity (by SEC and IEC), protein content (by UV), color, and turbidity. No increase in subvisible particles (by light obscuration) was observed. Slight differences observed in IEC data between the different set-ups were attributed to the simultaneous use of different HPLC systems, demonstrated by the control samples (undiluted drug product). Due to the high level of siliconization, the use of Venflon Pro Safety catheters from BD may lead to the formation of visible and subvisible particles.",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

What should a patient who relies on ventilator support bring to the hospital on the day of surgery,0,Trach and trach/vent-dependent patients require special considerations perioperatively. Please note the following: • A patient who relies on ventilator support for any part of the day or night should bring the home ventilator to the hospital on the day of surgery. • Respiratory Therapy (RT) can be reached at pager #7377 for any trach or trach/vent issues or concerns.,"• Inform the Day Surgery/Preoperative nurse of the existence of a MOLST during the health history review, phone call with the patient/patient representative, or during the pre-operative clinic visit. • The Day Surgery/Preoperative nurse will ask appropriate patients and/or patient representatives if they have advance care planning documents, such as a health care proxy and/or a MOLST. Note: If a patient has a MOLST, remind them to bring it to the hospital on the day of surgery.","• Patients who require a tracheostomy for severe BPD on high ventilator support or with severe tracheomalacia or pulmonary hypertension should generally NOT have surgical enteral access placed during the same trip to the OR because of the risk that the patient will not tolerate both procedures. • High PEEP, MAP, and FiO2 are typical indicators of the need to schedule surgery for enteral access sometime after the tracheostomy tract has matured (not sooner than 2 weeks post trach). • Ideally, neonatology, ORL, surgery, and anesthesia discuss these cases a week in advance of the scheduled surgery to determine whether surgical enteral access occurs with the tracheostomy. • Complex patients having both a tracheostomy and surgical enteral access performed during the same anesthetic, typically require a customized plan with multidisciplinary input from neonatology, surgery, GI, ORL, anesthesia, and potentially other consulting services.

What is the duration of validity for informed consent for inpatient services and when would a new consent need to be obtained,0,"• For inpatient services, consent is valid for the duration of the hospital stay, both during and following the procedure, intervention, or treatment. If there is a significant change in the patient's condition that would reasonably be expected to alter the treatment plan or require additional procedures (that was not identified or discussed with the patient as part of the initial consent), a new consent may need to be obtained for the subsequent treatment. • For outpatient services, the consent remains in effect throughout the course of continuing services, provided the patient is continuing the same or similar recommended procedure, intervention, or treatment for the same initial diagnosis. There is a general standard that a consent should be reviewed and updated on an annual basis to determine if the course of treatment or evaluation being provided has changed since the initial consent was signed. • When the treatment plan involves recurrent treatments and procedures, a consent is not required for each repetitive treatment/procedure, unless there is a significant deviation from the original plan, the patient's condition or diagnosis changes from the initial intent of the consent (which was not something identified or discussed with the patient and/or the parent/guardian as part of the initial consent form), or different treatments are being provided during the recurring treatment plan. • There is no specified or standard time period in which a consent should be obtained prior to a procedure. If the provider's practice is that the consent is normally obtained at a specified period prior to the planned procedure, intervention or treatment, (e.g., one week, one month, longer) the provider should maintain those practices.","If a child turns eighteen during the course of a study, and the study involves continuing diagnostic/therapeutic procedures, or any form of research intervention, informed consent must be obtained from the now adult in order to remain in the research. If the now adult subject is decisionally impaired, the investigator is required to consider and follow the consent policies set forth above. Parents do not automatically maintain the ability to consent for the now adult study subject unless they have been appointed by the court as the subject's legal guardian. A new consent document would need to be signed with the appropriate legally authorized representative, regardless of whether it is the same person that signed the consent form originally.","For studies initiated after the effective date of the GDS policy, NIH expects investigators to obtain participants' consent for their genomic and phenotypic data to be used for future research purposes and to be shared broadly. This also includes specimens used to generate a cell line as well. This informed consent requirement includes collection of clinical specimens used for research as well as specimens obtained specifically for research – both identifiable as well as de-identified. It is important to note that under this new policy, de-identified excess clinical specimens can no longer be considered non-human subject research. Also, a waiver of informed consent can longer be allowed. This is a major change and requires that investigators obtain consent in cases where previously was not necessary. In addition, it will be required to specify that samples and data may be used for unspecified and broad research topics not limited to the condition for which a subject is receiving care. Obtaining informed consent and specifying broad use will give investigators the greatest amount of flexibility in the future.","The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) regulations outline the basic general requirements of informed consent. 1. Informed consent be obtained for the subject or legally authorized representative. 2. Informed consent must be documented on a written consent form approved by the IRB and signed by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. Unless the IRB has approved a waiver of consent, the required elements or approved another method of obtaining consent as specified in the regulations. 3. The prospective subject or the legally authorized representative must be provided with information that: a. A reasonable person would want to have in order to make an informed decision about whether to participate; b. Is in language that is understandable; and c. An opportunity to discuss that information. 4. No informed consent may include any exculpatory language through which the subject or the legally authorized representative is made to waive or appear to waive any of the subject's legal rights, or releases or appears to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution, or its agents from liability for negligence. 5. Informed consent must be obtained before the initiation of any screening processes performed solely for the purpose of research. 6. HHS regulations require that informed consent must begin with a concise and focused presentation of the key information that is most likely to assist a prospective subject or legally authorized representative in understanding the reasons why one might or might not want to participate in the research. This part of the informed consent must be organized and presented in a way that facilitates comprehension. In general, Boston Children's Hospital will apply the key information summary requirement to all consent documents. If research is not under the jurisdiction, exceptions can be made on a case-by-case basis to not require a summary of key information","The following is a summary of the justifications and steps that need to be taken in order to conduct emergency research protocols with a waiver of informed consent: 1. Protocol justification: Researchers must provide a detailed description in their protocol that: a. The human subject is in a life-threatening situation, available treatments are unproven or unsatisfactory, and the collection of valid scientific evidence is necessary to determine the safety and effectiveness of particular interventions; b. Obtaining informed consent is not feasible, for three reasons: i. Participation in the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the subjects, ii. The study could not practicably be carried out without the waiver of informed consent; and iii. The study defines the length of the potential therapeutic window and the investigator has committed to attempting to contact a legally authorized representative to ask for consent for each subject within that window of time. 2. Community consultation : Consultation with appropriate community representatives will need to occur before the research begins 3. Public disclosure : Appropriate public disclosure will need to occur prior to the initiation of the study as well at the completion of the study 4. Ongoing attempts to obtain consent : Researchers planning to conduct research that does not include the informed consent of all subjects must provide information and attempt to obtain the consent from the subjects and/or the appropriate relatives or legally authorized representatives on an ongoing basis throughout the conduct of the research and at the conclusion of the research. a. It is also required that information be provided about the clinical investigation to the subject's legally authorized representative or to a relative, if feasible, if the subject dies before consent has been obtained 5. Summaries of attempts to obtain consent : If obtaining informed consent is not feasible and a legally authorized representative is not reasonably available, investigators must document and summarize their attempts to contact family members to obtain their consent. a. This information will need to be submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing review. 6. A separate Investigational New Device (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) - if subject to FDA regulations : Protocols involving an exception to the informed consent requirement under this FDA regulation must be performed under a separate investigational new drug application (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE) that clearly identifies such protocols as protocols that may include subjects who are unable to consent. a. The submission of those protocols in a separate IND/IDE is required even if an IND for the same drug product or an IDE for the same device already exists. b. Applications for investigations under this section may not be submitted as amendments under 312.30 or 812.35. 7. Independent Data Monitoring Committee: An independent data monitoring committee will need to be established. a. Requests for research that fall within this emergency informed consent exemption often take longer periods of time to review, therefore investigators should plan ahead. b. Often, it will be necessary to arrange for meetings with the IRB Chair and administrative staff in addition to the IRB meetings. Other representatives from Boston Children's Hospital, such as public affairs may also need to be contacted and involved.",4,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

Distance too great for ground transport (consult with Coordinator on Call) If the patient does not meet criteria for mobile ECMO transport, it is the responsibility of the MCP to notify the referring physician. 1. Mobile ECMO transports will only be conducted in a Boston Children's Hospital ambulance. 2. Once the mission has been accepted, the CS can proceed with the CCTT request per protocol. Please keep in mind that mobilization time will be longer than usual due to extensive preparation and resources needed for this type of transport and an ETA should be determined after discussion with the Crew Chief. 3. The CS will be asked by the Crew Chief to perform or assist with faxing a request for blood products to the referring hospital (attachment A). This will require the referring facility to send a signed reply fax notifying the CCTT that they have received our request for blood products. The CS will page the Crew Chief with this confirmation and print out returned signed fax. 4. The CS will contact Boston Children's Blood bank to order a cooler for the pending ECMO transport. This should be done with as much advance notice as possible for the blood bank to procure the appropriate cooler. If possible call the day before the transport is scheduled. 5. The CS will also attempt to obtain a recent chest x-ray via LifeIMAGE prior to departure so that cannula placement can be reviewed during the pre-departure huddle. 6. The CS will connect a CCTT RN with the bedside RN at the referring hospital for nursing report. a. Members of the Mobile ECMO team that are not members of the CCTT will complete an emergency contact form that will stay on file in the CCTT Communications Center and will be briefed on ambulance safety prior to the mission.","1.

How are protocols prioritized for placement on the agenda for review by the IRB,0,"After the pre-review process, protocols are placed on the agenda in the order in which they are received, a ""first come, first serve"" basis. 1. If an agenda is full, the protocol will be placed on the next open meeting agenda. 2. Deferrals are always placed in the agenda for the next upcoming meeting regardless of the number of new protocols received.","New research protocol applications that do not meet the criteria for exemption or expedited review are placed on the agenda for convened IRB review. Protocols are discussed on an individual basis. 1. All protocols are submitted electronically and made available to IRB members through the CHeRP system. a. All IRB members have full access to the complete submission under review. b. The electronic submission utilizes a series of SmartForms that request specific information for all protocols (e.g. research team, financial disclosure, funding information) and then branch to other forms as necessary for the category of research under consideration. i. Document uploads are in multiple sections of the SmartForms where the research team can provide complete information required for IRB review.","Continuing reviews that meet the regulatory criteria for expedited review are not placed on the agenda for full IRB review. 1. Each continuing review is assigned a primary reviewer. a. A Reviewer Worksheet is provided and needs to be completed and submitted at the end of the meeting. The worksheet is structured so that the reviewer can determine whether the regulatory criteria continue to be met. 2. Through the CHeRP system, the primary reviewer is provided with a copy of the continuing review SmartForm. They also have access to the entire protocol, and associated materials, including study history (i.e. previous continuing reviews and Reportable Events). 3. The procedures listed above apply to the review and voting process for continuing reviews. 4. The IRB determines the time frame for the subsequent continuing review. a. The continuing review time period must be set to occur within 1 year of the approval date. b. The default is one year, unless the IRB votes otherwise. Protocols that require continuing review in accordance with the Revised Common Rule, effective January 19, 2019 and the protocols approved prior to that date are referenced in the IRB policy: Continuing Review and Administrative Updates.","1. IRB members are assigned to serve as either primary or secondary reviewers for new protocols, continuing reviews, amendments/revisions, unanticipated problems, and other administrative and ethical issues pertinent to human subject protections. 2. All members are expected to read all protocols and submissions before a meeting and to participate in meeting discussions. 3. The IRB administrative staff assign reviewers based on the member's knowledge and expertise. The IRB administrative staff are responsible for ensuring that at least one member attending the meeting has the necessary knowledge and expertise to review the protocol. 4. When the agenda includes protocols that involve vulnerable populations, the IRB administrative staff is responsible for ensuring that at least one member attending the meeting has knowledge and experience in working with the study population. a. Example: For research sponsored by the Department of Education and/or funded by the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research that purposefully require inclusion of children with disabilities and/or individuals with mental disabilities as research subjects, the IRB will include at least one person who is knowledgeable about and experienced in working with these categories of participants. 5. Boston Children's Hospital reserves the right to reschedule protocols for review based on the experience and expertise of the members attending the IRB meeting and to seek expert consultation if deemed necessary. 6. If an IRB member is unable to attend a meeting, they are to contact the IRB office as soon as possible, to ensure that an alternate member be assigned. If it is determined that a member cannot attend after the protocols are distributed, there are two possible options: a. The member who cannot attend may review the protocol and submit written comments. However, this will not be included in a quorum. b. The IRB member may contact the IRB office and another IRB member will be assigned the review.","All protocols considered for expedited review will undergo an administrative pre-review. 1.

In preparation, the clinician and the patient should define goals for adequate sleep regarding timing and duration. 2. Adequate sleep should be documented by sleep diary and, whenever possible, actigraphy for 2 weeks before testing. 3. The MWT should be conducted when a patient is clinically stable and when treatments of any known sleep disorders are well-established and effective. 4. In patients with sleep-disordered breathing who are being evaluated for the effectiveness of therapy, the clinician should ensure effectiveness (efficacy and adherence) based on a review of downloaded data or self-reported use for non-PAP before testing. If adequate effectiveness is suboptimal, then the clinician should determine if the anticipated impact on the test results warrants rescheduling. The patient should use PAP/non-PAP therapy on the night before the MWT. 5. The clinician should develop a plan regarding the use of prescription medications, OTC agents, herbal remedies, and other substances. If the patient is chronically taking medications with alerting or sedating properties, then they should be continued at a stable dose. Changes in medications should be avoided for 2 weeks before testing. The patient should be instructed to consult with the clinician before starting a prescription or OTC medication before the test. 6. The patient's use of tobacco, caffeine and medications before and during MWT should be determined by the sleep clinician before the MWT. The patient should abstain from alcohol, marijuana, and other sedating substances on the day of the test. Drug screening may be indicated to ensure that sleepiness or wakefulness during the MWT is not influenced by substances other than medically prescribed drugs. The physician may request a urine specimen for drug screening; the timing of this specimen is determined by the physician. 7. Relevant clinical data such as preceding sleep schedules, PAP adherence, or other therapies should be available to the interpreting clinician. The MWT should be performed after the patient's major sleep period. Performance of a PSG before the MWT is at the discretion of the sleep clinician","1.

What regulations govern human subject research supported or funded by the National Institute of Justice NIJ and how do they protect the privacy of individuals,0,"Boston Children's Hospital's (BCH) Institutional Review Board (IRB) ensures that applicable DoJ requirements are appropriately addressed before it grants IRB approval. Research is considered to be conducted with support from or to involve a component of the DoJ when it: 1. Is funded by the DoJ (most often from the National Institute of Justice (NIJ). 2. It involves the cooperation, collaboration, or other type of agreement with DOJ, including sites, institutions, personnel. For example, research conducted within any facilities of the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) must comply with the specific BOP requirements. 3. It uses or is supported by property, facilities, or assets of a component of DoJ. For example, the Bureau of Justice Statistic or National Center for Juvenile Justice. Background Human subject research which is supported or funded by NIJ is governed by the DoJ regulations for the protection of human subjects (28 CFR 46: The Common Rule) and the DoJ Confidentiality of Identifiable Research and Statistical Information regulations (28 CFR 22). Together, these regulations: • Protect the privacy of individuals by limiting the use of private, identifiable information for research or statistical purposes. • Protect private information provided by individuals from use in any judicial, legal, or administrative process without the individual's prior consent. • Improve the scientific quality of NIJ research programs by minimizing the subject's concerns over the use of the data. • Clarify for researchers the limitations on the use of privately identifiable information for only research or statistical purposes. • Ensure that our understanding and knowledge of the broad criminal justice system will continue to advance by providing individual privacy protections.","As defined by DoJ: Human Subjects Research : DoJ applies the standard Common Rule (45 CFR 46) definition of Human Subjects Research. DoJ regulations provide the following additional information: Research is also defined as any program, project, or component thereof which is supported by DoJ and whose purpose is to develop, measure, evaluate, or otherwise advance the state of knowledge in a particular area. [28 CFR 22.2(c)] Identifiable private information : Defined by DoJ as information not extracted from public records which: • Is labeled by name or other personal identifiers, or • Can, by virtue of sample size or other factors, be reasonably interpreted as referring to a particular private person. National Institute of Justice : The DoJ program that funds most DoJ Human Subjects Research. Office of Justice Programs : An umbrella organizational structure within the DoJ, under which most DoJ research programs reside. Privacy Certificate : A requirement for all human subjects research supported by the NIJ and assures that the grant applicant understands their responsibilities to protect the confidentiality of research and statistical information and has developed specific procedures to ensure that this information is only used or revealed in accordance with the requirements of 42 USC §3789g and 28 CFR Part 22. Under a Privacy Certificate, the regulations that govern DoJ funded research do not allow the researcher and/ or research staff to make voluntary disclosures of matters such as current or past abuse or risk of harm to oneself or others. However, Massachusetts child and elder abuse reporting laws require the researcher to make these disclosures. In order to comply with both the regulations that govern DoJ funded research and the state reporting requirements, the researcher must provide a second informed consent (addendum) to allow such reporting, should a subject self-disclose give staff strong reasons to believe the subject may be in a dangerous situation. Here is a sample consent .","Investigator Requirements for research funded by NIJ: 1. Sign an Employee Confidentiality Statement. All researchers and research staff are required to sign employee confidentiality statements as a condition of grant or proposal approval by the NIJ. Certificates are maintained by the responsible Research Investigator. Here is the NIJ Model Employee Confidentiality Statement . 2. Obtain a Privacy Certificate and submit it to the IRB with application. Once obtained, the IRB will review the Privacy Certificate to ensure the confidentiality protections described in the Privacy Certificate are consistent with the confidentiality protections described in the IRB application and Informed Consent form. Investigators should refer to the NIJ Privacy Certificate Guidance and Model Privacy Certificate . The information that must be included are the sample format and instructions to avoid common problems. Note: The NIJ only accepts the Privacy Certificate. It does not issue or accept Certificate of Confidentiality issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Please see the separate IRB policy: Certificates of Confidentiality . 3. Keep Privacy Certificate Current and make necessary modifications. If data collection methodology and/or information provided in the Privacy Certificate changes as a result of IRB requirements, a revised Privacy Certificate must be provided to the NIJ and IRB prior to the commencement of research. 4. Accessing Military Volunteers: If BCH investigators seek to access military volunteers, they will need to do so in collaboration with a military researcher familiar with service-specific requirements. 5. Statements in Application. When submitting a research protocol, the applicant must provide the following: a. A summary statement which includes: ▪ Names and current affiliations of the investigators ▪ Title of the study ▪ Purpose of the study ▪ Location of the study ▪ Methods to be employed ▪ Anticipated results ▪ Durations of the study ▪ Number of subjects (staff or inmates) required and the amount of time required from each ▪ Indication of risk or discomfort involved as a result of participation. b. A comprehensive statement, which includes: ▪ Review of related literature ▪ Detailed description of the research method ▪ Significance of anticipated results and their contribution to the advancement of knowledge ▪ Specific resources required from the Bureau of Prisons ▪ Description of all possible risks, discomforts, and benefits to the individual subjects or a class of subjects, and a discussion of the likelihood that the risks and discomforts will actually occur ▪ Description of the steps taken to minimize risks ▪ Description of physical or administrative procedures to be followed to: ▪ Ensure the security of any individually identifiable data that are being collected for the study ▪ Destroy research records or remove individual identifiers from those records when the research has been completed ▪ Description of any anticipated effects of the research study on organizational programs and operations ▪ Relevant research material such as vitae, endorsements, sample consent statements, questionnaires, and interview schedules ▪ A statement regarding assurances and certification required by 28 CFR 46, if applicable. 6. Include the following in the Informed Consent Form: a. A statement describing the extent to which confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained (the subject should be informed that private, identifiable information will be kept confidential and will only be used for research and statistical purposes. However, the subject should be made aware that a disclosure of future criminal intent is not covered or protected by DOJ regulations. b. Under a Privacy Certificate, researchers and research staff are not permitted to report current or past abuse or whether a subject is at risk for harming himself/herself or others. Since this is in conflict with requirements of Massachusetts law (and most other state laws), the investigator must provide a second informed consent (addendum) to allow for such reporting, should there be a self-disclosure or if the research staff has reasons to believe the subject may be in a dangerous situation. Here is a NIJ Sample of the Consent for Reporting . If the research will be conducted outside of Massachusetts, the Office of General Counsel can advise on state law requirements in the state where the research will be conducted. c. If, due to sample size or some unique feature, the identity of the individual cannot be maintained, the subjects need to be explicitly notified. If the investigator intends to disclose any information, the subject needs to be explicitly informed what information would be disclosed, under what circumstances, and to whom. The subject must be informed of any potential risks which may result from this disclosure. d. Subjects must be informed that study is funded by NIJ. e. 28 CFR 46.117 allows for waiver of documentation of informed consent where criteria met. For reference, the NIJ has provided Informed consent requirements NIJ Guidance on Informed Consent Requirements . 7. The Principal Investigator must submit IRB approval letter and the informed consent to NIJ or applicable funding agency. 8.

Registered nurse range in experience from new graduate nurses to staff with over 30 years clinical practice on 10NW. Nurses on 10NW work 8 and 12 hour shifts to provide maximum support of the patient flow on the unit. As a surgical unit, many patients are admitted in the afternoon and evening. The combination of 8- and 12-hour shifts provide additional staff during peak times. Unit resources such as Patient Experience Representatives are considered when planning staffing. Staffing plans are arranged to accommodate the specific patient populations on 10NW. For example, staffing for spinal fusion patients for the first 16 hours is planned at a 1:2 nurse/patient ratio. The schedule is arranged by a Registered Nurse trained in assignment-making to ensure the appropriate mix of staff each shift seven days a week. The time scheduler ensures that there is a sufficient number of experienced staff on each shift so more experienced RNs are available as clinical resources to RNs with less proficiency. In addition, an RN specifically trained in the role of the Charge Nurse is assigned on each shift. The Charge Nurse provides management of daily unit operations, serves as clinical resource to staff, and ensures that appropriate chain of command is initiated when necessary. Approximately one quarter of the staff belong to the Leadership Group, which is comprised of Level II and Level III staff nurses who act as clinical leaders and participate in the development, implementation and evaluation of unit goals. The Surgical Programs Professional Development Specialists, Clinical Coordinator, Nurse Manager, Senior Nursing Director and Associate Chief of Nursing support the staff. Nurse Practitioners also are available in several specialties including Orthopedics, General Surgery and Plastic Surgery. The Case Manager, a Registered Nurse, is responsible for supporting discharge planning and utilization review process. Hospital supports such as administrative associates, Ascom Smart phone system, environmental services, laboratory, and hospital work stations reduce time away from patient care.","Staffing plans are developed based on the American Nurses Association principles of Nurse Staffing. The principles address patient care unit related, staff related and institution/organization related activities. Patient care related activities reflect the needs of the patients. The staffing plan considers the number of patients and the level of care required while incorporating physical and psychosocial limitations. For staff related activities, the principle needs of the patient populations determine the competencies required of the nurse. Staff skill mix and competencies, as well as leadership and organizational support guide this process. The hospital policies support the needs of patients and nursing staff. The nurse staffing for Waltham Inpatient Surgical Unit includes Registered Nurses and Clinical Assistants/ Administrative Support. The majority of Registered Nurses have several years' experience on one or more of the surgical units at Children's Hospital Boston. Nurses on Waltham Inpatient Surgical Unit work 8 and 12 hour shifts to provide maximum support of the patient flow on the unit. As mainly a surgical unit, many patients are admitted in the afternoon and evening. The combination of 8 and 12 hour shifts provide additional staff during peak times. Unit resources such as administrative associates are considered when planning staffing. The schedule is managed by the Inpatient Clinical Coordinator and Perioperative Nursing Director each shift to ensure appropriate use of staffing resources. The Inpatient Clinical Coordinator or Charge Nurse also provides management of daily unit operations serving as a clinical resource to staff and insuring that appropriate chain of command is initiated when necessary. The staff is supported by the Inpatient Clinical Coordinator, Perioperative Nursing Director and the Executive Director of Patient Care Services Satellites. Additional support for on-going education is provided by Staff Development and Nurse Educators at Children's Hospital Boston. The Patient Care Coordinator who is a Registered Nurse is responsible for supporting discharge planning and the utilization review process for both Longwood [Main] and Waltham campuses. Hospital supports such as housekeeping, Spectralink portable phones and computer work stations on wheels reduce time away from patient care.","Staffing plans are developed based on the American Nurses Association (ANA) principles of Nurse Staffing.

Thus, these policies recognize the myriad needs for both patients and nursing staff. The nurse staffing for 7 West includes registered nurses and clinical assistants. Registered nurses range in experience from new graduate nurses to many staff with over 20 years clinical practice of pediatric experience. The nurses on 7 West work 8 and 12 hour shifts to provide maximum support of the patient flow on the unit. As a medical unit, the majority of our patients are admitted between 5 pm and 1 am. The combination of 8 and 12 hour shifts provide additional staff during peak times. Unit resources such as patient experience representatives are considered when planning staffing. Staffing plans are arranged to accommodate the specific patient populations on 7 West. The charge nurse from the off going shift picks the assignment with input from the staff nurses based on experience, consistency and the mix of acuity of each patient. The use of the CAMEO tool is utilized to guide assignment making. The schedule is arranged by a registered nurse trained in assignment-making to insure the appropriate mix of staff each shift seven days a week. The time scheduler ensures that there is a sufficient number of experienced staff on each shift so more experienced RNs are available as clinical resources to RNs with less proficiency. In addition, an RN specifically trained in the role of the charge nurse is assigned on each shift. The charge nurse provides management of daily unit operations serves as a clinical resource to staff and insures that appropriate chain of command is initiated when necessary. A resource nurse role is available to support staff M-F on the day shift. Approximately one third of the staff belong to the Leadership Group, which is comprised of Level II and Level III staff nurses who act as clinical leaders and participate in the development, implementation and evaluation of unit goals. The staff is supported by the Pediatric Medical Services Programs Nurse Educator, a Nurse Manager and a Nursing Director. Nurse Practitioners also are available in several sub-specialties. The Case Manager who is a Registered Nurse responsible for supporting discharge planning and utilization review process is also part of the team.

Evaluation of the staffing plans is ongoing, and uses trends in identified nurse-sensitive indicators to evaluate its effectiveness. Subsequently, ""changes in staffing levels, including changes in the overall number and/or mix of nursing staff, are based on the analysis of standardized, nursing-sensitive indicators. The effect evaluated using the same criteria"" (ANA, 1999).","The Main Operating Room (MOR) is staffed with qualified Registered Nurses and Surgical Technologists (ST) 24 hours per day, 7 days a week. Each OR is staffed with a minimum complement of two RNs or one RN and one ST. Supplemental staff support clinical activities such as Clinical Assistants, Materials Technicians, and Sterile Processing Technicians. Elective Surgical Block is assigned to each of the surgical services for scheduling of elective procedures. There is dedicated staffing and room availability for urgent/emergent/traumatic procedures. The staffing plan for the unit is based on the American Nurses Association (ANA) and the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) guiding principles. An optimal staffing plan is based on the elective block schedule and historical averages. Registered Nurses and Surgical Technologists work 8, 10, and 12 hour shifts to provide maximum coverage. Off hours, weekends, and holidays are at minimum staffed with an in-house team consisting of two Registered Nurses and one Surgical Technologist. Additionally, the MOR has general call (either two Registered Nurses or one Registered Nurse and one Surgical Technologist) on nights, weekends, and holidays for additional support if needed. Specialty solid organ transplant call is staffed with either two RN's or one RN and one ST 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

What are the potential causes of a heart murmur in infants and children and why is it important to differentiate between a benign murmur and a murmur indicating heart disease,1,"A heart murmur is characterized by the sound of turbulent blood flow that may be caused by a valve defect or other anatomic variant. While heart murmurs are a common clinical finding in infants and children, there are some cases where it may be an indicator of heart disease.","Assess the patient for: • Cyanosis (with or without congestive heart failure): Suspect cyanotic congenital heart disease in a neonate with a preductal PaO2 <150 mm Hg while receiving an FiO2 of 1.0. A neonate with a PaO2 of <50 mm Hg while receiving an FiO2 of 1.0 is highly likely to have cyanotic congenital heart disease. • Shock (with or without congestive heart failure): Suspect congenital heart disease in the neonate with inadequate systemic perfusion (shock) and metabolic acidosis. • Cardiac murmur (with or without cardiomegaly): Suspect congenital heart disease in the neonate with a cardiac murmur and increased heart size on chest x-ray; however, the absence of cardiomegaly does not rule out heart disease. Pathologic murmurs may result from: ◦ stenotic valvular lesions (eg: AS, PS) – audible immediately after birth and persist, with a harsh quality ◦ L-R shunt lesions (eg: large VSD, AV canal, PDA) - occur later (ie: days to weeks of age) as PVR decreases, with a blowing quality that is usually systolic but may be continuous (in the case of a PDA) • Cardiac rhythm disturbances Congenital heart disease should be considered in the neonate who presents with an arrhythmia. Although most neonates with arrhythmias will have a structurally normal heart, certain lesions are associated with rhythm disturbances (eg: Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve and supraventricular tachycardia). • Failed congenital heart disease screen The critical congenital heart disease screen was developed to facilitate identification of neonates with potentially serious cardiac lesions prior to development of clinical symptoms. It is typically performed after 24 hours of life prior to discharge from the newborn nursery. Refer to Appendix 1: Failed Critical Congenital Heart Disease Screen Algorithm .","• For any patient with a NEW murmur ◦ Refer patient to cardiology for further evaluation ◦ If this murmur has already been documented as an ""innocent murmur"" by a cardiologist, then a referral to cardiology is not necessary • For Day Surgery Unit (DSU) patients 1 ◦ If a patient is under the age of 1 year with innocent murmur documented by the pediatrician: ▪ Safe to proceed as long as there are no cardiac symptoms ▪ Clearance by BCH cardiology is NOT required, as long as the patient has no cardiac symptoms ▪ Obtain pediatrician note(s) for supporting documentation • Document pertinent cardiac symptoms ◦ Examples includes: ▪ Chest pain/palpitations ▪ Cyanosis/blue spells ▪ Difficulty with feeding ▪ Dyspnea/shortness of breath ▪ Dizziness/lethargy/syncope • Direct any questions or concerns to the PCCC attending anesthesiologist (Dr. Ugarte is available as an additional resource as needed) 2","Assess the patient for: • Signs of pulmonary hypertension (pre- and post-ductal oxygen saturation differential, accentuated second heart sound, +/- murmur of tricuspid regurgitation) • Arterial blood gas (note FiO2 and whether sample is obtained pre- or post-ductally) • Impairment in oxygenation: • Oxygenation Index (OI) = FiO2 x MAP/ PaO2 • Hypoxemic respiratory failure is defined as an OI ≥ 15 x 2 within a six hour time period • An OI > 40 on conventional ventilation or > 60 on HFOV may be considered an indication for ECMO • Presence/ absence of lung disease and/or abnormal pulmonary vascularity on CXR","Patients with a history of hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) have an underdeveloped left ventricle. This causes insufficient systemic blood flow and a mixing of low and high oxygenated blood on the right side of the heart.

What are the proper procedures for handling and disposing of sharps to prevent injuries and accidental exposure,0,"The BCH Hospital Safety Management Program maintained a focus on quality improvement throughout the year. This focus resulted in numerous accomplishments and new developments in all aspects of the program. The following is a summary of some of the 2019 program improvements. • Collaborated with Engineering to continually improve lockout/tag-out procedures that include both shutdown procedures and personal protective equipment requirements. • Enhanced the surgical and procedural fire safety training program to allow greater hands-on participation. • Began a Peripritive Health & Safety Oversight Commitee • Code Red Root Cause Analysis Task Force - reducing false alarms and targeted improvements • Started a behavioral health employee injury steering committee • Continued to collaborate with other North American pediatric hospitals regarding employee injury prevention strategies and benchmarked improvement metrics. As a member of SPS cohorts, continued to focus on quality and safety improvements across the priority areas of slip/trip/fall prevention, prevention of employee injuries associated with overexertion and patient behavioral events. • Collaborated with Occupational Health Services and Infection Control to continue tracking and trending of sharps injuries across hospital campuses, actively engaged departments using non-safety devices to encourage transition to safety devices and involved the Supply Chain department in identifying the hospital's inventory of safety and non-safety sharps and in developing a process for flagging new purchases of non-safety sharps devices. • Established a Steering Committee charged with reviewing employee safety events associated with patient behaviors and implemented tasks forces dedicated to identifying effective training approaches for staff and to ensuring that staff are provided with appropriate resources and emotional support following events of this kind. • Using a participatory ergonomic approach, continue to support department-based safety committees in Environmental Services, Food Services and Radiology Departments with goals of involving employees directly in early identification of hazards and real-time coaching in best practices and engaging both front- line staff and department leadership in development of corrective actions. • Collaborated with Patient Safety and Quality on transition from paper-based employee safety event reporting to implementation of on-line incident reporting using rL Solutions/SERS. • Expanded safe patient handling and mobilization program efforts at BCH to include procurement of additional types and amounts of safe patient handling equipment, standardization of internal processes and equipment brands, development of educational resources for staff and increased representation of front-line staff on safe patient handling and mobilization committee. • Worked with the Radiation Safety Committee, HTM, Radiology and PPSQ, to improve x-ray safety practice througout BCH. Several recommendations were made and the primary improvement recommended was to hire an institutional x-ray safety officer. This was accomplished in September 2018. • Implemented monthly Enviroment of Care SWAT drills. • Implemented quarterly Environment of Care SWAT drill debriefs in which all units/departments who participate in the drills as well as the multi-displinary team who conducted the drills were invited to attend. • Implemented Advanced Technologies Group, Inc. (ATG) into the EOC Rounds program for all patient care & non-patient care areas on the Boston Main Campus. The BCH Safety Management Program will continue to focus on quality improvement in 2020.","OHS maintains a sharps injury log for recording percutaneous injuries from contaminated sharps. The log contains the type and brand of device involved, the department or work area where the exposure incident occurred, and an explanation of the incident. Confidentiality of the injured staff member is maintained. OHS uses an electronic system for recording pertinent information on each exposure incident.","Non-Human Use Permits A radioisotope permit must be obtained prior to work with radioactive materials. The Principal Investigator must apply for the permit to the RSO and the Radiation Safety Committee. In addition to the application process, the PI must fulfill training requirements commensurate with the responsibilities of a Permit Holder. A Permit Holder is a Principal Investigator as identified by the Vice President of Research, that the Radiation Safety Officer and the Radiation Safety Committee have qualified as responsible for oversight of the safety of the individuals working in his/her laboratory. Permit Holders must ensure that individuals in the lab use safe work practices and follow established policies, procedures and laws regarding the use of radioactive materials. Permit holder responsibilities include: • Oversees compliance with the BCH Radioactive Materials security policy. • Ensures compliance with the rules and guidelines established by the RSC and/or the RSO for the safe handling of radioactive materials and other sources of radiation. • Ensures that employees under his/her supervision have attended Radiation Safety Training and are instructed in the use of safety devices and proper laboratory procedures. • Ensures Adequate planning of experiments and procedures to ensure that all necessary safety precautions are taken. • Provides the Radiation Safety Office with the names of all personnel involved with operational procedures using radiation, and updates this information as necessary. • Directs personnel under his/her supervision to comply with recommendations of the RSC and RSO regarding the monitoring of radiation exposure and bioassay requirements. • Limits the use of radionuclides to those nuclides and approved rooms specified on his/her permit. • Ensures compliance with the established procedures for receiving, shipping, and disposing of radioactive materials. • Maintains required records related to inventory control (receipt, use, storage and disposal of radionuclides). • Ensures that adequate personal surveys are conducted and recorded.

When should a prescriber order for an abdominal xray KUB be obtained after the placement of a postpyloric feeding tube,0,"• Registered Nurses (RNs) and Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs), who have demonstrated competency in the insertion of post-pyloric feeding tubes, may place these tubes, following the guidelines described in this document. • Recommended sizes: ◦ 6 Fr 22 in non-weighted feeding tube with a stylet for patients ≤ 5kg. ◦ 8 36-43 in Fr non-weighted feeding tube with stylet for patients > 5kg. ◦ Consider use of 10 Fr 43 in feeding tube in patients > 12 years of age. • Obtain a prescriber order for abdominal x-ray (KUB) after feeding tube placement to confirm proper tube position.","To prepare the Patient • Verify the Prescriber Order. • Verify the identity of the patient as described in the Nursing Policy and Procedure: Patient Identification. • Explain procedure to the patient and/or family to promote understanding and cooperation. • Perform hand hygiene and wear protective equipment as described in the Infection Control Manual: Hand Hygiene and Standard Precautions policies. To insert the tube • Examine the stylet/tube for a secure tube/luer fit. • Flush tube through the stylet port with water to ensure easy stylet removal after placement. • Position patient in a comfortable position, recommend elevating head of bed 15-30 degrees as tolerated. • Using the tube, approximate distance to the stomach mark (I) by measuring the distance from the tip of nose to the ear lobe, then down to the xiphoid process. Approximate the duodenal mark (II), by measuring the distance from the xiphoid process to the mid axillary line. Approximate the jejunal mark (III) by adding 5 – 10cm after the duodenal mark. • (5-7cm Newborn-1yr) • (7-10cm 1-4 yrs) • (10cm >4yrs) • Using a permanent marker, make a series of slashes along the tube at the identified measurements. • Lubricate the tip of the tube and then slowly insert tube into the nare. Direct the tube posteriorly parallel to the nasal septum. • If patient experiences any sign of respiratory distress or coughing during insertion, remove the tube. • Continue advancing tube to the first mark (gastric). • After tube is advanced to the first mark, roll patient into extreme right decubitus position as tolerated to facilitate passage of tube from stomach into duodenum. • Advance the tube to the second mark (duodenal) while simultaneously insufflating small volume of air (5-10 mL briskly), a ""subtle"" give may be noted as the feeding tube crosses the pylorus. The tube is then advanced another 5-10 cm (per above guidelines) to third mark to ensure jejunal or distal duodenal placement. • Insufflate 3-5 mL of air into the tube and then pull back on the syringe plunger. Aspiration of less than 1 mL represents a positive ""snap test"", as the plunger often snaps back into the syringe. • If snap test is not positive, gently pull tube back to the first (gastric) mark and repeat steps 13-15 until positive snap is elicited (up to 3 attempts) and then proceed to next step. • Auscultate 2-5 mL of air over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Listen for presence of high- pitched crackles. Auscultate over distal esophagus for absence of sounds. • With one hand holding feeding tube at the nare, gently remove stylet from the tube by withdrawing the stylet with your free hand. Secure tube to face with dressing and tape. Label the tube as ""post-pyloric"" and document exit mark in electronic health record. • Consider maintaining patient in right side-lying position for up to 30 minutes as tolerated to facilitate peristalsis of tube into jejunum. • Obtain KUB to confirm proper placement of post-pyloric tube. • Do not use tube until post-pyloric placement is confirmed by KUB and communicated by prescriber. ◦ Note: Tube does not have to be situated in the jejunum to be considered a successful post-pyloric placement. It needs only be located past the pylorus, preferably between the second part of the duodenum and the ligament of Treitz of jejunum. If true jejunal depth is required, please speak with the fluoroscopy department. • Re-confirmation of tube placement by KUB is necessary if there are any concerns for displacement.",Complete patient care documentation as described in Patient Care Manual. In addition document specific Post-pyloric Feeding Tube Insertion information as follows: Medication Medications given related to tube insertion. Administration record Patient Care Note number marking on feeding tube at nare. Flowsheet/ Electronic documentation Progress Note Procedure note to include: Size and length of tube Patient tolerance of procedure Results of the snap test Best location of auscultation of air after insufflation Document KUB ordered/obtained to confirm placement prior to use Note the number marking on the feeding tube at the nares,"• Obtain a Gastroenterology (GI) consult prior to discharge to establish follow-up, and discuss a plan for replacement of tube when needed. • In general, if oral intake is expected to improve over the first year of life (for example, feeding immaturity related to prematurity or aspiration), nasal tubes may be a viable option for discharge to home, after discussion with the family. ◦ Pros: Avoidance of surgery/laparoscopy, temporary nature of the tube ◦ Cons: Tubes prone to dislodgement, need to maintain tube on the face, nasal congestion/obstruction from the tube • Patients are generally discharged with a post-pyloric tube (versus NG) if they improved with inpatient post-pyloric feedings, and/or continue to have severe illness that prompted the original placement of the post-pyloric tube (e.g. respiratory, neuromuscular, or GER), especially if being transferred to a rehabilitation facility (versus home). • Specific considerations for home post-pyloric feeding that should be discussed amongst the medical team, GI consulting service, and family are: ◦ Replacement of dislodged post-pyloric tubes does not occur at home, in a clinic, or in most locals Emergency Departments. The infant would likely need to present to the BCH ED to replace the tube via fluoroscopy. ◦ Post-pyloric feeds run continuously, over a majority of the hours per day, which may complicate activities, especially in the outpatient setting.","This reference tool describes a technique for clearing an obstruction from an enteral feeding tube. • Refer to the Nursing Patient Care Policy and Procedure Manual Gastrointestinal section for additional information about enteral tube management. • Refer to the Enteral Tube Type reference tool for detailed product descriptions. Warm water is the preferred agent for managing enteral tube obstructions. Using a gentle back and forth or pulsing motion with the syringe, push warm water through the tube to break up the obstruction. Carbonated beverages (i.e. cola) or cranberry juice are seldom effective and should not be used. These substances leave a residue on the lining of the enteral tube and pose additional clogging risk. If water fails to clear the obstruction, an enzyme solution should be used. The enzyme solution requires a provider order . It is called ""Gastrostomy Tube Obstruction Plan"". To clear a clogged or blocked enteral feeding tube using an enzyme solution, follow these steps: 1. Crush 1 sodium bicarbonate tablet (325 mg). Mix the powder with the contents of one enzyme capsule (Zenpep 5,000 units) in 10 mL warm water. Mix into a slurry. Allow solution to dissolve completely. 2. Instill the slurry into the obstructed feeding tube using a 10-30mL syringe. Allow 60-minute dwell time to ensure the enzyme solution has maximal contact with the obstruction. 3. Using a syringe, pull back to withdraw the slurry solution from the feeding tube (slurry as well as the obstruction). Avoid using excess force to prevent enteral tube damage. 4. Flush the enteral feeding tube with warm water prior to resuming use. Note: If you are unable to instill warm water or slurry solution due to complete obstruction of enteral feeding tube then follow protocol for replacing the tube.",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
What equipment is required for procedure planning when administering medication or fluids through a central ven vein according to the hospital policy,1,"1. Epoprostenol requires a designated infusion line labeled with ""Epoprostenol, Do Not Flush"". 2. A back up epoprostenol cassette/syringe and a backup infusion pump are available on the patient's unit at all times, and accompany the patient whenever he/she leaves the unit. Note: Hospital syringe pump administration may be preferred in procedural and ICU locations. 3. Intravenous epoprostenol is administered through a Q-syte cap to prevent mechanical interference with continuous flow. 4. Patients receiving intravenous epoprostenol by means of outpatient infusion pump (CADD Legacy) should continue to utilize CADD Legacy tubing with in-line 0.2 micron filter 5. Patients receiving intravenous epoprostenol by means of hospital syringe pump should utilize opaque tubing with the addition of a 1.2 micron filter. 6. Do not use epoprostenol to prime a central venous catheter (CVC) or peripheral IV (PIV). 7. A CVC is preferred for epoprostenol administration. Peripheral intravenous infusion of epoprostenol may be used temporarily until central access is established. a. When utilizing peripheral access, a large vein is preferred. 8. See the Prostacyclin (Epoprostenol/Flolan, Treprostinil/Remodulin) Switch Line Reference Tool for further information on switching epoprostenol infusion from PIV to CVC or from CVC to PIV. 9. No other medications, intravenous fluids (IVF), or infusions may be administered in same vascular access device as epoprostenol (i.e. nothing may be ""y'd"" in with the epoprostenol tubing). a. Consult the Pulmonary Hypertension Program if planning to use a multi-lumen vascular access device. b. Hospital Syringe pump: Change the infusion tubing with each syringe change 10. Change the Q-syte every 72 hours with syringe/tubing change, or more frequently, to coordinate with syringe changes. Outpatient Infusion Pump (CADD Legacy): Change the cassette, infusion tubing, and Q- syte every 72 hours regardless of volume remaining in cassette. May need to change more frequently based on rate of administration.","PICC: Peripherally inserted central catheter, a long thin tube inserted through a vein in patients arm and passed through to larger veins near the heart. Used to deliver medications and other treatments.","1. Follow Infection Prevention and Control Hand Hygiene and Standard Precautions policies. 2. Administer parenteral nutrition (PN) infusions and lipids via a large volume pump (if in a bag or bottle) or via a syringe pump (if in a syringe). Use the drug library. 3. When used for nutrition, lipid doses that exceed 3g/kg/day must be approved by the Clinical Nutrition Service (CNS) attending. 4. A 1.2 micron filter is used for PN, lipids and specific medications (per Pharmacy Guidelines). Refer to the Intravenous Filters Use Policy/Procedure for more information. 5. When administering PN/Lipids and medication concurrently through the same lumen, refer to Formulary or call Pharmacy or safe compatibility information prior to administering the medication. If no information is available, the medication should not be administered concurrently with the PN/lipids. 6. If PN needs to be stopped for a medication or procedure (greater than 30 minutes), contact the patient's dietitian for guidelines prior to stopping or making any changes to PN infusion. Obtain orders for cycling as indicated. 7. If CVC is used, follow all procedures as described in the Patient Care Manual for management of Central Venous Catheters. 8. Infuse bag / syringe until empty or according to the following table, whichever comes first: Post-Hang IV Expiration Times 12 HR Lipid Emulsion, Omegaven®, propofol, Ambisome®, other lipid based IV infusions 24 HR PN 1. If a peripheral intravenous catheter is used for peripheral PN infusion, assess site hourly for phlebitis or infiltration. See the Patient Care Manual: Peripheral Intravenous Catheter Care and Management. 2. For patients on cycled PN, cycle PN up over 30 minutes (at ½ rate) and down over 60 minutes (½ rate for 30 minutes and ¼ rate for 30 minutes) unless otherwise ordered. 3. If initiating cycled PN or patient is newly cycling off PN, contact patient's dietician for glucose monitoring guidelines. Obtain orders for glucose monitoring as indicated.","A CVC is a central venous catheter. This description refers to the final location of the tip as central. The catheter may be inserted into a peripheral vein and then the tip is threaded into a central location, called Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC). Or the CVC may be inserted percutaneously into a more central vein with a shorter distance for the tip to travel to a central location. Examples of long-term CVCs include a port, where the access point remains under the skin, or a Broviac ® or Hickman ® catheter where the access point sits outside the skin; these are generally placed in the operating room (OR) or in interventional radiology (IR). An example of a short-term CVC is a percutaneously placed central venous line (CVL) which may be placed in the ICU, IR, OR, Emergency Department (ED), or in the cardiac catheterization lab (Cath Lab).","Umbilical vein catheterization (UVC) is indicated for certain neonates to provide emergency or central vascular access. For emergency vascular access, the UVC may be placed in a ""low"" position (ie, just far enough into the vein to get blood return); for central vascular access (ie, for vasoactive infusions) the UVC should be placed at the IVC/RA junction. Umbilical artery catheterization (UAC) is indicated for invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring. In general, placement of a UAC on transport, if not done prior to the team's arrival, is only considered for critically ill neonates receiving vasoactive infusions.",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1

The IND application must contain information in three broad areas: 1. Animal Pharmacology and Toxicology Studies - Preclinical data to permit an assessment as to whether the product is reasonably safe for initial testing in humans. For many Sponsor-Investigator (or investigator-initiated INDs), this requirement can be met by submitting a Letter of Authorization cross- referencing a third party's regulatory application. Also included in the IND are data on any previous experience with the drug in humans. 2. Manufacturing Information - Information pertaining to the composition, manufacturer, stability, and controls used for manufacturing the drug substance and the drug product. This information is assessed to ensure that the company can adequately produce and supply consistent batches of the drug. For many Sponsor-Investigator (or investigator-initiated INDs), this requirement can be met by submitting a Letter of Authorization cross-referencing a third party's regulatory application. 3. Clinical Protocols and Investigator Information - Detailed protocols for proposed clinical studies to assess whether the initial-phase trials will expose subjects to unnecessary risks. Also, information on the qualifications of clinical investigators to assess whether they are qualified to fulfill their clinical trial duties. Finally, commitments to obtain informed consent from the research subjects, to obtain review of the study by an institutional review board (IRB), and to adhere to the investigational new drug regulations. Boston Children's Hospital Internal Review Process The IND/IDE Resource Group (IIRG) is a group of experts from across the hospital that internally reviews the IND application prior to submitting to the FDA. All Investigators seeking to submit an IND to the FDA will first be required to participate in this internal review process to: 1. Review the proposed protocol 2. Review requirements of the institution and of sponsoring an IND 3. Provide recommendations for how the Investigator can meet their regulatory obligations. FDA Submission 1. Once the IND is submitted, the sponsor must wait 30 calendar days before initiating any clinical trials. 2. During this time, the FDA has the opportunity to review the IND for safety to assure that research subjects will not be subjected to unreasonable risk. 3. At the end of this 30-day review period, the FDA may issue a ""Study May Proceed"" letter or a clinical hold letter. Information to be submitted with the IRB Application Complete IND information must be submitted with any protocol submitted to the IRB that involves an investigational drug or biologic. 1. Investigators are required to submit IND information provided by the sponsor, or if the investigator is also the sponsor a copy of the letter from the FDA that assigns the IND. 2. The IRB will not release a final approval until all IND information is complete. 3. Protocol administrators will be responsible for making sure this information is obtained prior to release of the IRB approval notification and informed consent document. 4. If there is any question as to whether an IND is required, the IRB may require, as part of the review and approval process, that the investigator contact a Boston Children's Hospital Regulatory Affairs Specialist or the FDA to discuss the protocol and to determine if an IND is required. 5. Investigators who propose to use investigational or marketed drugs for unapproved indications must also follow FDA regulations 21 CFR 50 and 56. a. For the most part, the FDA regulations are the same as HHS regulations 45 CFR 46. The regulations are similar with regard to IRB organization, composition, procedure, record keeping, and criteria for approval of research protocol, and informed consent documentation. b. At the time of a continuing review, if an investigator is the sponsor of an IND, a copy of the annual report to the FDA will be requested.","Expanded Access of Investigational Drugs The use of investigational drugs and biologics is usually limited to subjects enrolled in clinical trials under an Investigational New Drug (IND). However, test articles may show some promise before the trials are completed. When there is no satisfactory standard treatment for a serious, life-threatening, or a debilitating condition, the FDA has a mechanism that allows expanded access to the drugs before the clinical trials are complete. When no satisfactory alternative treatment exists, subjects are generally willing to accept greater risks from test articles that may treat life-threatening and debilitating illnesses. The following mechanisms expand access to promising therapeutic agents without compromising the protection afforded to human subjects, or the thoroughness and scientific integrity of product development and marketing approval. 1. 21 CFR 312 Subpart I: Expanded access use of an Investigational New Drug (IND) 2. 21 CFR 314: Drug products 3. 21 CFR 600: Biological products Emergency Use INDs In instances where a patient needs to be treated before a written application can be submitted, the FDA can grant an emergency IND. Researchers should use the FDA's website for the comprehensive process. 1. Once an Emergency Use IND is granted, the physician-sponsor has 15 calendar days to submit the written application to the FDA. 2. The Emergency Use IND must be reported to the Boston Children's Hospital IRB within 5 working days. a. Any subsequent use of the test article is subject to IRB review prior to initiation of treatment. The emergency use of a test article, other than a medical device, is a clinical investigation, the patient is a participant, and the FDA may require data from an emergency use to be reported in a marketing application. However, HHS regulations do not permit data obtained from patients to be classified as research involving human participants, nor permit the outcome of such care to be included in any report of a research activity subject to HHS regulations. FDA Exemption Federal law requires that a drug be the subject of an approved marketing application before it is transported or distributed across state lines. Because there is likelihood that a sponsor will want to ship the investigational drug to clinical investigators in other states, the investigator must seek an exemption from that legal requirement. The Investigational New Drug (IND) is the means through which the sponsor technically obtains this exemption from the FDA (21 CFR 312). This requirement applies to any expanded access mechanism obtaining the drug/biologic. Informed Consent The FDA requires informed consent to be obtained from the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, unless both the physician-investigator and a physician who is not otherwise participating in the clinical investigation certify in writing all of the following (21 CFR 50.23(a)): 1. The subject is confronted by a life-threatening situation necessitating the use of the test article. 2. Informed consent cannot be obtained because of an inability to communicate with, or obtain legally effective consent from, the subject. 3. Time is not sufficient to obtain consent from the subject's legal representative. 4. No alternative method of approved or generally recognized therapy is available that provides an equal or greater likelihood of saving the subject's life. Intermediate-Size Patient Population Access In cases where more than a single patient will be treated with an investigational product (but fewer than a treatment IND/protocol), an intermediate-size patient population expanded access IND or protocol can be submitted to the IRB via CHeRP as a New Research Activity. a. An intermediate-size patient population IND is traditionally submitted by a single physician to treat multiple patients. b. The investigational product may or may not be under development for marketing. Treatment IND/Protocol A treatment IND (21 CFR 312.34 and 312.35) is a mechanism for providing eligible subjects with investigational drugs for the treatment of serious and life-threatening illnesses for which there are no satisfactory alternative treatments. A treatment IND may be granted after sufficient data have been collected to show that the drug ""may be effective"" and does not have unreasonable risks. Data related to safety and side effects are collected, treatment INDs also serve to expand the body of knowledge about the drug. There are four requirements that must be met before a treatment IND can be issued: 1. The drug is intended to treat a serious or immediately life-threatening disease. 2. There is no satisfactory alternative treatment available. 3. The drug is already under investigation, or trials have been completed. 4. The trial sponsor is actively pursuing marketing approval. A sponsor may apply for a waiver of local IRB review under a treatment IND, if justified to be in the best interest of the subjects and if a satisfactory alternate mechanism for assuring the protection of human subjects is available (i.e. review by a central IRB). Such a waiver does not apply to the informed consent requirement. An IRB may still opt to review a study even if FDA has granted a waiver. It is also possible for a treatment protocol to be submitted under an existing IND for that investigational product. The same requirements are required for a treatment protocol. Treatment INDs and treatment protocols should be submitted to the IRB in CHeRP as New Research Activity.","For studies initiated after the effective date of the GDS policy, NIH expects investigators to obtain participants' consent for their genomic and phenotypic data to be used for future research purposes and to be shared broadly. This also includes specimens used to generate a cell line as well. This informed consent requirement includes collection of clinical specimens used for research as well as specimens obtained specifically for research – both identifiable as well as de-identified. It is important to note that under this new policy, de-identified excess clinical specimens can no longer be considered non-human subject research. Also, a waiver of informed consent can longer be allowed. This is a major change and requires that investigators obtain consent in cases where previously was not necessary. In addition, it will be required to specify that samples and data may be used for unspecified and broad research topics not limited to the condition for which a subject is receiving care. Obtaining informed consent and specifying broad use will give investigators the greatest amount of flexibility in the future.","For studies using data from specimens collected before the effective date of the GDS Policy, there may be considerable variation in the extent to which future genomic research and broad sharing were addressed in the informed consent materials for the primary research . In these cases, an assessment by the IRB will be made to ensure that data submission is not inconsistent with the informed consent. NIH will accept data derived from de-identified cell lines or clinical specimens lacking consent for research use that were created or collected before the GDS Policy effective date. In some circumstances, broad sharing may not be consistent with the informed consent of the research participants whose data are included in the dataset. In such circumstances, institutions planning to submit aggregate or individual-level data to NIH for controlled access should note any data use limitations in the data sharing plan as part of the funding request. These data use limitations will be specified in the Institutional Certification submitted to NIH prior to the award. For studies involving human subjects that were initiated before the policy's effective date and used consent forms that do not meet the expectations of the GDS policy, NIH anticipates that investigators will plan a transition to a consent for future research uses and broad sharing. If possible, particularly for new or additional collections of specimens.",4,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

These include low hematocrit, albumin<3.5 mg/dL and total lymphocyte count < 1500 cells/mm3. References 20.

Preoperative antibiotics Appropriate antibiotics to cover common organisms are needed. One study has suggested that use of clindamycin increases risk of infection. There are several studies as discussed above that have demonstrated a high rate of gram negative infections, and therefore coverage for these organisms makes sense. In addition, appropriate timing of antibiotic dosing is critical, as inappropriate dosing as defined as antibiotics given greater than 60 minutes prior to incision represent a risk of infection. The current recommendations of the AAOS are to use appropriate antibiotics for 24 hours postoperatively. One study failed to demonstrate a benefit of continuing antibiotics beyond 24 hours when a drain is in place. References 24.

How should the transfer set and needle be disposed of after transferring the solution to the sterile evacuated container,1,"1. Aseptically remove the cap on the spiked end of the transfer set, holding the housing firmly between the thumb and index finger of the right hand while pressing against the finger flanges. The exposed spike is the critical site. It should be in the direct flow of air from the HEPA filter until insertion. 2. Place the tip of spike in the set site ring of the LVP bottle and thrust through with a quick positive pressure while steadying the bottle with the other hand. 3. Close the clamp on the tubing of the transfer set. 4. Invert the LVP bottle and hang from a hook on the hanger rod in the hood. 5. Carefully remove the cap on the delivery end of the transfer set and aseptically connect to a sterile needle. 6. Prepare the receiving container (i.e., the sterile empty evacuated container) by removing the protective aluminum cap on the bottle. 7. Swab the surface of the container with an alcohol swab. 8. Using aseptic technique remove the protective sheath from the needle attached to the transfer set. The exposed needle is a crucial site. 9. Using aseptic technique, place the needle at a 60 degree angle to the rubber closure. Insert the needle with the bevel edge pointed upward and with slight pressure away from the bevel. Once the needle has penetrated the closure, quickly move the needle to the vertical position and complete the penetration. 10. Open the clamp on the transfer set. The solution should flow freely into the empty evacuated container. The flow of solution can be regulated by adjusting the clamp. Complete the Procedure 11. Once the appropriate volume of solution has been transferred to the sterile evacuated container, pinch the clamp on the transfer set shut. 12. Using aseptic technique, remove the needle and transfer set from the empty evacuated container. 13. Discard the needle in a syringe bucket. The source container and transfer set may be discarded in regular trash unless it has been used in the preparation of hazardous material. 14. The container with the transferred solution can now be used as previously described in the preparation of admixture solutions.","1.

What are the requirements for obtaining and maintaining a Privacy Certificate when conducting research funded by NIJ,0,"Investigator Requirements for research funded by NIJ: 1. Sign an Employee Confidentiality Statement. All researchers and research staff are required to sign employee confidentiality statements as a condition of grant or proposal approval by the NIJ. Certificates are maintained by the responsible Research Investigator. Here is the NIJ Model Employee Confidentiality Statement . 2. Obtain a Privacy Certificate and submit it to the IRB with application. Once obtained, the IRB will review the Privacy Certificate to ensure the confidentiality protections described in the Privacy Certificate are consistent with the confidentiality protections described in the IRB application and Informed Consent form. Investigators should refer to the NIJ Privacy Certificate Guidance and Model Privacy Certificate . The information that must be included are the sample format and instructions to avoid common problems. Note: The NIJ only accepts the Privacy Certificate. It does not issue or accept Certificate of Confidentiality issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Please see the separate IRB policy: Certificates of Confidentiality . 3. Keep Privacy Certificate Current and make necessary modifications. If data collection methodology and/or information provided in the Privacy Certificate changes as a result of IRB requirements, a revised Privacy Certificate must be provided to the NIJ and IRB prior to the commencement of research. 4. Accessing Military Volunteers: If BCH investigators seek to access military volunteers, they will need to do so in collaboration with a military researcher familiar with service-specific requirements. 5. Statements in Application. When submitting a research protocol, the applicant must provide the following: a. A summary statement which includes: ▪ Names and current affiliations of the investigators ▪ Title of the study ▪ Purpose of the study ▪ Location of the study ▪ Methods to be employed ▪ Anticipated results ▪ Durations of the study ▪ Number of subjects (staff or inmates) required and the amount of time required from each ▪ Indication of risk or discomfort involved as a result of participation. b. A comprehensive statement, which includes: ▪ Review of related literature ▪ Detailed description of the research method ▪ Significance of anticipated results and their contribution to the advancement of knowledge ▪ Specific resources required from the Bureau of Prisons ▪ Description of all possible risks, discomforts, and benefits to the individual subjects or a class of subjects, and a discussion of the likelihood that the risks and discomforts will actually occur ▪ Description of the steps taken to minimize risks ▪ Description of physical or administrative procedures to be followed to: ▪ Ensure the security of any individually identifiable data that are being collected for the study ▪ Destroy research records or remove individual identifiers from those records when the research has been completed ▪ Description of any anticipated effects of the research study on organizational programs and operations ▪ Relevant research material such as vitae, endorsements, sample consent statements, questionnaires, and interview schedules ▪ A statement regarding assurances and certification required by 28 CFR 46, if applicable. 6. Include the following in the Informed Consent Form: a. A statement describing the extent to which confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained (the subject should be informed that private, identifiable information will be kept confidential and will only be used for research and statistical purposes. However, the subject should be made aware that a disclosure of future criminal intent is not covered or protected by DOJ regulations. b. Under a Privacy Certificate, researchers and research staff are not permitted to report current or past abuse or whether a subject is at risk for harming himself/herself or others. Since this is in conflict with requirements of Massachusetts law (and most other state laws), the investigator must provide a second informed consent (addendum) to allow for such reporting, should there be a self-disclosure or if the research staff has reasons to believe the subject may be in a dangerous situation. Here is a NIJ Sample of the Consent for Reporting . If the research will be conducted outside of Massachusetts, the Office of General Counsel can advise on state law requirements in the state where the research will be conducted. c. If, due to sample size or some unique feature, the identity of the individual cannot be maintained, the subjects need to be explicitly notified. If the investigator intends to disclose any information, the subject needs to be explicitly informed what information would be disclosed, under what circumstances, and to whom. The subject must be informed of any potential risks which may result from this disclosure. d. Subjects must be informed that study is funded by NIJ. e. 28 CFR 46.117 allows for waiver of documentation of informed consent where criteria met. For reference, the NIJ has provided Informed consent requirements NIJ Guidance on Informed Consent Requirements . 7. The Principal Investigator must submit IRB approval letter and the informed consent to NIJ or applicable funding agency. 8. PI Requirements and Responsibilities for research conducted within the Federal Bureau of Prisons: a. The researcher must assume responsibility for actions of any person engaged to participate in the research project as an associate, assistant, or subcontractor to the investigator. 9. Archiving : Follow guidelines to submit data resulting from their projects to NIJ for archiving with the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD), including copies of the informed consent document, data collection instruments, surveys, or other relevant research materials. Except for computerized data/records maintained at an official DOJ site, records that contain non- disclosable information directly traceable to a particular person may not be stored in or introduced into an electronic retrieval system (such as the EMR).","As defined by DoJ: Human Subjects Research : DoJ applies the standard Common Rule (45 CFR 46) definition of Human Subjects Research. DoJ regulations provide the following additional information: Research is also defined as any program, project, or component thereof which is supported by DoJ and whose purpose is to develop, measure, evaluate, or otherwise advance the state of knowledge in a particular area. [28 CFR 22.2(c)] Identifiable private information : Defined by DoJ as information not extracted from public records which: • Is labeled by name or other personal identifiers, or • Can, by virtue of sample size or other factors, be reasonably interpreted as referring to a particular private person. National Institute of Justice : The DoJ program that funds most DoJ Human Subjects Research. Office of Justice Programs : An umbrella organizational structure within the DoJ, under which most DoJ research programs reside. Privacy Certificate : A requirement for all human subjects research supported by the NIJ and assures that the grant applicant understands their responsibilities to protect the confidentiality of research and statistical information and has developed specific procedures to ensure that this information is only used or revealed in accordance with the requirements of 42 USC §3789g and 28 CFR Part 22. Under a Privacy Certificate, the regulations that govern DoJ funded research do not allow the researcher and/ or research staff to make voluntary disclosures of matters such as current or past abuse or risk of harm to oneself or others. However, Massachusetts child and elder abuse reporting laws require the researcher to make these disclosures. In order to comply with both the regulations that govern DoJ funded research and the state reporting requirements, the researcher must provide a second informed consent (addendum) to allow such reporting, should a subject self-disclose give staff strong reasons to believe the subject may be in a dangerous situation. Here is a sample consent .","Boston Children's Hospital's (BCH) Institutional Review Board (IRB) ensures that applicable DoJ requirements are appropriately addressed before it grants IRB approval. Research is considered to be conducted with support from or to involve a component of the DoJ when it: 1. Is funded by the DoJ (most often from the National Institute of Justice (NIJ). 2. It involves the cooperation, collaboration, or other type of agreement with DOJ, including sites, institutions, personnel. For example, research conducted within any facilities of the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) must comply with the specific BOP requirements. 3. It uses or is supported by property, facilities, or assets of a component of DoJ. For example, the Bureau of Justice Statistic or National Center for Juvenile Justice. Background Human subject research which is supported or funded by NIJ is governed by the DoJ regulations for the protection of human subjects (28 CFR 46: The Common Rule) and the DoJ Confidentiality of Identifiable Research and Statistical Information regulations (28 CFR 22). Together, these regulations: • Protect the privacy of individuals by limiting the use of private, identifiable information for research or statistical purposes. • Protect private information provided by individuals from use in any judicial, legal, or administrative process without the individual's prior consent. • Improve the scientific quality of NIJ research programs by minimizing the subject's concerns over the use of the data. • Clarify for researchers the limitations on the use of privately identifiable information for only research or statistical purposes. • Ensure that our understanding and knowledge of the broad criminal justice system will continue to advance by providing individual privacy protections.","The NIH Policy on CoCs applies to ""all biomedical, behavioral, clinical, or other research funded wholly or in part by the NIH, whether supported through grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, other transaction awards, or conducted by the NIH Intramural Research Program, that collects or uses identifiable, sensitive information that was commenced or ongoing on or after December 13, 2016.

Refer to Infection Control Reference Tool: Transporting a Patient on Precautions for more information. Equipment 1. Dedicate the use of reusable patient care equipment (i.e., stethoscope, blood pressure cuff, etc.) when possible. If use of common equipment is unavoidable, then adequately clean and disinfect before use on another patient. Activity Room 1. Patients on Contact Precautions may not use the Activity Room or other common areas on the unit (e.g., the kitchen). If special circumstances arise (e.g., lengthy hospital stay) the Primary Nurse, Child Life Specialist, and Infection Control assess the situation and make accommodations to meet the patient's needs whenever possible. Siblings and other visiting children may not use the Activity Room. Parents and visitors 1. Parents and visitors pose little risk for transmission of infection because they are not involved in the direct care of other patients. Therefore, they do not need to wear gown and gloves. However, they should be aware of the need for precautions and how they are implemented. 2. Parents and visitors should be instructed and encouraged to practice diligent hand washing or hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand sanitizer while visiting and always before leaving the room and hospital. 3.

Inform the area receiving the patient in advance regarding the need for precautions. When transporting a patient on precautions within the healthcare facility, the appropriate use of barriers to prevent spread of the infectious agent is based upon the mode of transmission and the patient's circumstances (e.g., age, mental status, etc.). For example, because it may be difficult for an infant to wear a mask, the transporter may need to wear a face mask and make arrangements to avoid other patients, staff and visitors in route (such as using an empty elevator). The patient should not be placed in a waiting room but be taken directly to a single patient room in the department (e.g., exam room) with the door closed.

Optimal weekday staffing is achieved through scheduling staggered shift start times. Staff works 8, 10 or 12 hour shifts. Each day starts with 3-4 RNs at 7:00am. Staff is then staggered in each hour between 8:00am-2:00pm to meet the needs of throughput from the OR. Our peak staffing is achieved between 1:00pm-3:00pm in which we have 22-24 nurses to cover the unit, provide resourcing, and relieve for breaks prior to staff beginning to depart at 2:30pm. As staff continues to depart throughout afternoon and evening, our staffing numbers gradually deplete. We have 8-10 nurses during hours 8:00pm-11:00pm and then drop to three (3) nurses overnight. Night shift is staffed with two nurses available for recovery and one RN for Mandell 3 operations. We also have one RN on-call every night from 11pm-7am. Staffing needs and predicted OR volume is reviewed a week in advance to make any staffing adjustments. The charge nurse also reviews staffing for the following day and will adjust staffing as needed, based on finalized OR schedule and anticipated volume and acuity of patients. Holidays are staffed on a 24-hour basis with 2-3 nurses. In addition, one nurse is on-call. The decision to use on-call personnel is made by the PACU Charge Nurse and is guided by an assessment of patient census and acuity in the PACU, the ability to maintain American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses (ASPAN) standards of a minimum of two RNs in the recovery area when there is at least one patient. Optimally, the decision to call in a nurse requires one-hour notice. Weekend daytime operations vary depending on decisions made by OR governance. When we have scheduled weekend operations, we provide coverage with nurses for POH, Liaison and PACU. Staffing numbers reflect amount of OR rooms running for that day. Decisions regarding weekend operations are made well in advance to allow adequate planning when balancing schedule. Night weekend coverage is provided by two RNs between the hours of 7:00pm to 7:00am.

Where can nurses find guidelines for line choice when considering a CVC for a patient,0,"Central Venous Catheters (CVCs) are placed in patients who require long-term intravenous access. A CVC is inserted into the central venous system. The general types of CVCs that are used in BCH's patient population include: • PICC/Power Injectable PICC • Port/Power Injectable Port • Broviac/Hickman • IJ/Subclavian/Femoral Catheters • Intracardiac lines • Dialysis Catheters (once converted) • Apheresis Catheters (once converted) Indications for CVC Refer to the Vascular Access Decision Making Algorithm for line choice guidelines. The most common indications for a CVC are: • Current access unable to support treatment • Dialysis • Hemodynamic monitoring • Long-term IV medical therapy (chemo, solid organ, stem cell transplant) • Long-term IV nutritional therapy (short bowel syndrome, intestinal failure) • Pheresis • Plan for contrast injection","Refer to the Vascular Access Decision Making Algorithm for line choice guidelines.

What are the potential symptomatic responses a patient may experience during a tilt study and how should the nurse discuss the treatment plan with the prescriber,1,"• The perioperative nurse informs the attending anesthesiologist about the existence of a MOLST form and/ or a Resuscitation Status Order. • The attending anesthesiologist discusses treatment preferences with the patient or patient representative. Recommendations are then provided for care during the procedure. • Please note, if the patient or patient representative requests a modification of MOLST orders for the time of perioperative care, the treating clinician should determine the appropriate plan of care and medical orders based on the current hospital level of care; which may not align with the MOLST orders. MOLST forms should not be modified on a temporary basis. A plan for reinstatement of original MOLST orders is developed, documented in a progress note and communicated to intraoperative and immediate postoperative care teams. • On the day of surgery, if there is not a copy of the current MOLST form in the EMR a copy should be scanned prior to the procedure. For more information on how to complete this step, see Patient Care Reference Tool: How to Scan a MOLST Form into the Electronic Health Record • Prior to the start of a procedure, members of the perioperative care team are aware of any treatment limitations. ◦ MOLST is reinstated at the time the patient leaves the care of the attending anesthesiologist (when the patient is discharged home ), unless otherwise documented. For more information on process of reviewing DNR orders before anesthesia see the Ethics Advisory Committee's Guidelines for Do- Not-Resuscitate Orders. • For more information on the MOLST process in the perioperative areas, please see the patient care reference: MOLST Process for the Perioperative Areas","1. A MOLST is a medical document that contains medical orders which are effective immediately. It replaces the Massachusetts Comfort Care/ Do Not Resuscitate Order Verification Protocol by addressing preferences regarding other life-sustaining treatment in addition to resuscitation. 2. A MOLST clinician (a Massachusetts licensed nurse practitioner, physician's assistant or physician ) will review and sign the form after the patient has signed to reflect the plan of care. 3. Note: A valid MOLST form is one that is signed and dated by both a competent patient (or a patient representative) and a MOLST Clinician. A photocopy is also valid. 4. The MOLST form contains medical orders that are immediately actionable. 5. Note: In the event that it is not possible to verify treatment preferences, MOLST orders should be followed using best clinical judgment. 6. The Massachusetts MOLST form is recognized and honored across treatment settings regardless of care setting or point of the MOLST origination. 7. Out-of-state MOLST forms should be taken into consideration as a representation of the patient's wishes, but a Massachusetts MOLST form is the only form recognized as a medical order for care and treatment in Massachusetts. 8. After validation, a MOLST clinician should discuss with the patient or the patient's representative how to align the MOLST form contents with the current plan of care within the hospital setting, which should be documented in the patient's medical record.. 9. The MOLST form will physically remain with the patient throughout their hospital stay. 10. Scan a copy of the MOLST form into EMR. For more information, see the Patient Care Reference Tool: How to Scan a MOLST Form into the Electronic Health Record 11. The MOLST form will remain with the patient at the time of discharge. ◦ If the MOLST form remains unchanged during the hospitalization, no modification is required. ◦ Complete a new MOLST form at the time of discharge if treatment preferences changed during the course of the hospitalization. For more information on how to complete a MOLST see below . 12. MOLST is used voluntarily and can be revised or revoked by a competent patient (over the age of 18 year or an emancipated/mature minor) or the patient representative.","The following questions and answers are intended to help researchers and the IRB determine when immediate safety plans are required. 1. What type of questionnaires or assessments would require an immediate safety action plan? An immediate safety plan is required for questionnaires or assessments that either: a. Include individual items that indicate that someone is at real potential risk for harm – this would include single items that ask about suicidality, or child abuse, or plans to commit a violent act, etc. or b. Use tools that validly correspond to specific psychological conditions and have established ""clinically- actionable"" values or scores that suggest a potential diagnosis (e.g., Beck Depression Inventory) Participants who score in the clinical range on validated assessments or provide a concerning answer on individual items should trigger the safety action plan. 2. Do quality of life assessments or questionnaires that may ask about sadness, feeling anxiousness, or levels of stress require a safety action plan? These assessments are not typically developed to identify potential mental/psychological illnesses or actionable conditions such as depression and mood disorders. These scales do not require an immediate safety plan. a. However, when possible, investigators should consider ways of maximizing the potential for benefit for subjects who agree to participate in research. b. Depending on the type of information learned and the relationship with the subject, there may be ways to utilize the information from these questionnaires for the benefit of the subject. i. For example, responses may suggest that it may be helpful to offer a subject a referral to a social worker or provide additional resource information. c. Investigators also need to consider whether it may be beneficial to include results of validated assessments in the medical record so that other care providers may have access to the information and the ability to use the information for comparisons over time or if thought to be clinically relevant for planning care. i. These plans should be described in the potential benefit section of the research protocol and included in the informed consent document or process. 3. What should an immediate safety plan include? The following components must be included in a safety plan and specified in the protocol submitted to the IRB. In general, safety plans should align with standard clinical practice. If a safety plan deviates from standard practice, a rationale for the deviation should be provided. The IRB also expects that, when necessary, those who develop safety plans seek guidance from individuals experienced with standard clinical practice. This will help assure the plan meets the standards required. Items to note: a. The assessments should be reviewed immediately when a subject is present or within 24 hours if the information is collected remotely. b. The individual performing/collecting and reviewing the assessments must be qualified to interpret the results or have plans to consult with qualified individuals within a specified time frame. Protocols should include these plans based on the acuity of the response. c. Plans need to include immediate referral to appropriate mental health personnel and services for further assessment and management d. Plans must also include appropriate notification of the concern to the subject and parents/legal guardians (if applicable). e. Plans should include notification of relevant agencies (i.e., Dept. of Children and Families) or use of law enforcement personnel (e.g., police, security, etc.) to detain the individual for assessment and necessary services (if applicable). f. The consent form should include information so that subjects/recognize the potential need to breach confidentiality and obtain necessary services. Recommended steps, methods and guidance on how covered persons are to perform process, recognizing every case and patient are different.","In certain circumstances (listed below) an oncology prescriber must modify a previously active chemotherapy order to authorize continued treatment after confirming the chemotherapy orders are still consistent with the plan of care and patient condition at the time of review. 1. The following scenarios require a chemotherapy plan modification by an authorized oncology prescriber (see table above) in order to reactivate or continue treatment: a. When the planned location of care changes. b. Resuming a chemotherapy plan that was previously suspended. c. Actual start date of treatment does not match start date designated in original chemotherapy plan. d. To modify the dose, duration of infusion, or route of administration of a chemotherapeutic drug within an active chemotherapy orderset in COE or chemotherapy plan in Cerner Oncology. 2. When there has been a change in level of care for a patient during an active chemotherapy plan (e.g. unplanned admission for acute care; transfer to the ICU/ICP), the prescriber will communicate with the pharmacist and oncology charge nurse regarding the plan to continue or suspend the chemotherapy order. If the order is place in COE, the active orderset must be modified to indicate order is being suspended. 3. Chemotherapy Continuation/Modification Orders are authorized by an oncology prescriber and verified by chemotherapy-competent nurses and chemotherapy-competent pharmacists . a. The oncology prescriber: i. Evaluates the patient's clinical status for appropriateness of therapy; ii. Confirms that the appropriate chemotherapy order is being continued; and iii. Verifies administration date(s). Note: A hematopoietic stem cell transplantation attending physician must sign the GVHD Prophylaxis and approve each methotrexate dose by modifying methotrexate order.","1.

What are the responsibilities of recipient institutions in communicating research misconduct to the NIH according to NOTOD19020,0,"BCH is committed to fostering a research environment that promotes responsible research practices in compliance with regulatory and institutional requirements, and to helping prevent Research Misconduct. Covered individuals have an obligation to report allegations of research misconduct and to provide evidence to the RIO. Allegations should be specific. Individuals should not discuss the allegation(s) with others prior to discussion with the RIO. BCH will respond to each Allegation in a thorough, competent, objective, and fair manner, and will take reasonable steps to conduct an impartial and unbiased Research Misconduct proceeding. Individuals are required to inform the RIO immediately of any attempted violation of procedural integrity, or any breach of confidentiality or privacy. The RIO will address any concerns regarding personal, professional, of financial conflict of interest among individuals involved in the proceeding. A. Non-Retaliation Through the RIO, BCH will take all reasonable and practical steps to protect good faith Complainants , witnesses, and panel members, their positions and reputations, and counter potential or actual retaliation against them. B. Confidentiality and Privacy To the extent feasible, all individuals involved in a Research Misconduct proceeding shall make diligent efforts to limit disclosure of information only to those who have a need to know, in order to minimize damage to the reputation of individuals, protect the confidentiality of the Respondent and Complainant, and of research records or evidence from which research subjects might be identified. The RIO can, at his/her discretion, communicate any aspect of the matter covered by this Policy with other agencies, departments, and offices whose jurisdiction or interests are implicated by the alleged misconduct and take necessary actions to protect the scientific integrity of the project. C. Cooperation Individuals involved in a Research Misconduct proceeding are expected to fully participate and cooperate in good faith. Obstruction of any aspect of the proceeding may itself constitute evidence of Research Misconduct. Obstruction includes intentionally withholding or destroying evidence in violation of a duty to disclose or preserve; falsifying evidence; encouraging, soliciting, or giving false testimony; and attempting to intimidate witnesses, potential witnesses, or potential leads to witnesses or evidence. D. Coordination with Other Academic Institutions Harvard Medical School (""HMS"")- If the Respondent had an appointment as fellow or faculty at HMS at the time of the alleged Research Misconduct, the RIO shall confer and discuss the logistics of joint review with HMS. The RIO, following consultation with the Compliance Department, may choose to delegate any or all of the functions described in the Policy to HMS, for resolution according to the ""Principles and Procedures for Dealing with Allegations of Faculty Misconduct."" The decision of whether to delegate and what policy is applicable shall be made in accordance with the following criteria and conditions: a. Substantial involvement of full-time Harvard faculty or fellow as co-investigators in a research project; b. Substantial involvement of investigators from Harvard-affiliated hospitals other than the BCH in a research project; c. Substantial involvement of Harvard students in a research project; d. Involvement of BCH medical staff so senior as to call into question ability of BCH-specific processes to be fair and neutral; and e. Funding by HMS or HMS is the primary site receiving sponsored funds. BCH shall retain jurisdiction over part or all proceedings and apply this Policy when the following conditions are present: a. All significant witnesses and all Respondents are employees of or otherwise directly affiliated with BCH; b. BCH personnel have subject matter expertise and availability to undertake fact-finding in regard to the subject matter of the Allegations; c. When other institutions' personnel are involved, the other institutions' RIOs express a preference for BCH' s process as opposed to HMS' s process and agree to full cooperation with the BCH process; and d. Funding by BCH for the research or BCH is the primary site receiving funds. Howard Hughes Medical Institute (""HHMI"")- If the Respondent is an employee of HHMI at the time of the alleged Research Misconduct, RIOs will jointly decide whether BCH will apply this Policy or whether the HMS or HHMI Policy on Research Misconduct will apply. Other Institutions- If the Respondent is an employee at other non-Harvard-affiliated institution at the time of the alleged Research Misconduct, the RIO shall coordinate further review with the other institution. RIOs at impacted institutions jointly determine which institution will bear primary responsibility. BCH is committed to sharing of information and keeping other institutions informed as to the proceedings, where the interest of both BCH and other institutions are significantly impacted.","The NIH Policy on CoCs applies to ""all biomedical, behavioral, clinical, or other research funded wholly or in part by the NIH, whether supported through grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, other transaction awards, or conducted by the NIH Intramural Research Program, that collects or uses identifiable, sensitive information that was commenced or ongoing on or after December 13, 2016. CoCs are automatically granted, and the requirements of such must be complied with, whenever a NIH- funded activity falls within the scope of the policy. Investigators and institutions are responsible for determining when a NIH-funded activity falls within the scope of the policy.","For studies using data from specimens collected before the effective date of the GDS Policy, there may be considerable variation in the extent to which future genomic research and broad sharing were addressed in the informed consent materials for the primary research . In these cases, an assessment by the IRB will be made to ensure that data submission is not inconsistent with the informed consent. NIH will accept data derived from de-identified cell lines or clinical specimens lacking consent for research use that were created or collected before the GDS Policy effective date. In some circumstances, broad sharing may not be consistent with the informed consent of the research participants whose data are included in the dataset. In such circumstances, institutions planning to submit aggregate or individual-level data to NIH for controlled access should note any data use limitations in the data sharing plan as part of the funding request. These data use limitations will be specified in the Institutional Certification submitted to NIH prior to the award. For studies involving human subjects that were initiated before the policy's effective date and used consent forms that do not meet the expectations of the GDS policy, NIH anticipates that investigators will plan a transition to a consent for future research uses and broad sharing. If possible, particularly for new or additional collections of specimens.","1. Is it possible to voluntarily submit data to the NIH GWAS Repository? Yes. The NIH is hoping that even when the policy is not triggered, investigators will voluntarily share their data. If an investigator voluntarily submits data to GWAS – the submission must be in compliance with the GWAS Policy. 2. How do you submit materials for the open-access portion of the Repository? Unless otherwise described in the grant announcement, these materials (The protocol, questionnaires, variables measured and other supporting documentation) should be submitted at the same time the genotype/phenotype information is submitted to the controlled access portion. Specific instructions will be part of the grant instructions. 3. Who is responsible for submitting data to the NIH GWAS Repository? The person/entity who is receiving the NIH funds for the GWAS analyses is responsible for submitting the data. For multi-institution research, the single submitting person/center is responsible for ascertaining the compliance of all centers. 4. How do you submit coded genotype-phenotype data to the NIH GWAS Repository? a. Each submission must include a letter of certification signed by the Institutional Official. This letter certifies that the IRB has reviewed and verified the following: i. That the submission of the data is consistent with the informed consent form of study participants from whom the data was initially obtained ii. That the de-identification of the data sets is consistent with the GWAS standards (HIPAA standards) iii. That the risks to individuals, their families and groups or populations associated with the data submitted has been considered and iv. That the genotype and phenotype data to be submitted were collected in a manner consistent with the Common Rule (federal law re: human research protections) b. The submitting investigator must provide the following documents to the IRB: i. Description of what genotype/phenotype data is being submitted to the NIH GWAS Repository ii. Copy of the consent form/s used to collect the initial data/samples NOTE : This must include forms from all sites. iii. Description of the method/s used for coding the data iv. Description of how the link will be maintained with assertion that it will never be shared with the NIH. v. NIH ID# of the grant 5. Is there a specific 'certification' form that you should use for submission of genotype/phenotype data into the NIH GWAS Repository? Yes. Children's Hospital has developed language for a certification letter to be signed by the Vice President, Research Administration. Before signing the required form, the Vice President will want to know that that the IRB has made the required determinations. Please contact the IRB office to discuss the submission of data. When review is completed, the certification letter with institutional signature will be sent to the PI for submission to NIH. 6. What happens if the IRB determines that the initial consent forms are not consistent with submission of data to the NIH GWAS Repository? The data cannot be submitted. The only way to submit the data would be if study participants were re- contacted and re-consented. a. Re-consent requires submission of an amendment to the IRB. The IRB would have to consider whether re-contact and re-consent is feasible and/or appropriate. b. NIH has said that investigators can request funds to cover the expense of re-consenting. 7. What if study participants cannot be re-contacted for a new consent? At this time, the NIH will not accept data without an IRB approved consent form. 8. What if the initial consent form included language consistent with sharing genetic data with the NIH but limited the research to a single disease/condition? The IRB can determine that the data can be submitted – but that the NIH GWAS Repository can only make the data available for that restricted use. 9. What if the original data and tissue were collected under a waiver of consent? At this time, the NIH will not accept data that was obtained without informed consent and a form documenting that consent.","1. What should investigators include in their grant applications? Applicants should state in the cover letter if they are proposing to conduct GWAS research, or plan to access GWAS data in the NIH repository as part of the proposed research. a. Applicants Proposing GWAS Applications and proposals that include GWAS, regardless of the requested costs, are expected to include as part of the Research Plan either a plan for submission of GWAS data to the NIH- designated GWAS data repository, or an appropriate explanation for why submission to the repository will not be possible. This information should be included as part of the Research Plan of the application. These instructions apply to all applications proposing GWAS, including those submitted in response to a GWAS-specified Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). However, when responding to existing FOAs for GWAS, applicants should pay particular attention to any additional instructions, especially those related to data sharing. b. Applicants Intending to Access the NIH GWAS Data Repository Applicants who plan to seek data from the NIH GWAS data repository for use in research will be expected to meet data security measures and to submit a data access request, including a Data Use Certification that is co-signed by the investigator and the designated Institutional Official. In the Research Strategy section, the applicants should briefly address plans for requesting access to data and state their intention to abide by the Data Use Certification. Applicants who intend to access data in the NIH GWAS data repository for the proposed research may wish to secure that access prior to submitting their application for NIH support.",3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
What resources are available to assist employees in learning about the Hospitals safety policies and standards,0,A number of resources are available to assist employees in learning about the Hospital's safety policies and standards. Some of these include:,"This management plan identifies policies, procedures, and programmatic guidance to assist in meeting the intent of the plan, including maintenance, testing, and inspection procedures to support operational reliability and to manage risks within the EOC. The Hospital uses information from the risk assessments in establishing and implementing policies and procedures in order to achieve the lowest potential for adverse impact on safety to all in the facility. Most of these policies may be found in the Safety Policy Manual and are available on the Hospital intranet. Each Hospital department may develop and maintain procedures addressing hazards that specifically relate to that department. These documents serve as a guideline for minimizing hazards within the department or function.","The Safety Program is directed and coordinated by the Environmental Health and Safety Department working in conjunction with the Safety Committee. The Director of the Environmental Health and Safety Department has the authority, when necessary, to take action to alleviate hazards which may cause injury to people or damage to equipment or buildings. The Director of the Environmental Health and Safety Department, or designee, is available by page (pager #7233) 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. This individual directs collection of organizational deficiencies and plans improvement. This is done to provide support and improvement to comply with the Environment of Care standards, which are designed to provide a safe and effective environment for patient care. The goals of the Safety Program are to: • provide educational programs and expert consultation to help make Boston Children's Hospital a safer place for patients, visitors, employees, staff and volunteers; • assist the Hospital in managing hazardous chemical waste in accordance with applicable laws and regulations; • assist the Hospital in complying with applicable environmental, occupational, and safety laws and regulations; and • assist the Hospital in complying with Joint Commission ( TJC ) and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requirements. To meet these goals, the Safety Program: • reviews safety policies and procedures on an on-going basis; • conducts training to assist employees in recognizing and controlling hazards in their work area; • promotes the ongoing hazard surveillance and information collection and evaluation program which reviews accident and critical incident data for trends and evaluation of corrective follow-up action; • uses various publications and meetings to provide safety information to department managers","Hospital Orientation – The focus of orientation is the mission and philosophy of the organization, human resources policies & procedures, general safety, emergency management and infection control. 1.

The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for when it is appropriate to request a cost transfer and what is the allowable mechanism to do so for both personnel and non-personnel costs. 1. Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals and Other Non-Profit Organizations (OMB Circular A-110) prescribes that every institution in receipt of federal funds must maintain adequate financial management systems. The purpose of a financial management system is to facilitate programmatic decision-making. 2. There are a variety of appropriate mechanisms that can be adopted, at the departmental or laboratory level, that meet the federal standard for financial management systems. CHB requires that an appropriate method of grants management be maintained, which facilitates decision-making during the award period . Federal regulations recognize that the principal investigator is ultimately responsible for ensuring that all original transactions are appropriately and accurately charged to the correct project based on the benefit received on the project. Attributing costs to the appropriate project should be done prospectively. Therefore, the request for a cost transfer should only be required in rare circumstances. 3. The federal Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals (OASC-3) state that ""any costs allocable to a particular sponsored agreement under the standards provided in (OASC-3) may not be shifted to other sponsored agreements in order to meet deficiencies caused by overruns or other fund considerations, to avoid restrictions imposed by law or by terms of the sponsored agreement, or for other reasons of convenience."" Simply stated, cost transfers should be initiated to ensure expenses are aligned with the projects they benefit, not just as a means to correct over or underspending. CHB cannot allow cost transfers made for inappropriate purposes, but recognizes that there will be certain circumstances when cost transfers must be done to correct charges on sponsored projects. 4. The government also requires that cost transfers be done in a timely manner. Several government agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), state that cost transfers should be accomplished within 90 days. CHB has adopted this guideline and has defined the 90-day interval to begin with receipt by the Financial Manager of the run sheet listing the cost to be transferred. Thus, cost transfer forms should be submitted within 90 days of receipt of the run sheet. 5. Significant cost transfers delayed beyond 90 days without strong justification may be greeted skeptically by government enforcement and funding agencies. In addition, delays of greater than 90 days before requesting cost transfers result in a significant increase in the workload to carry out the transfer. Increased delays result in substantially more journal entries and computations that must be completed by both the departmental grants administrator and central fund accountant. 6. Investigators should therefore understand that significant cost transfers beyond 90 days, particularly absent a compelling excuse, may lead funding agencies to view them as careless, poor stewards or haphazard; may jeopardize a transfer which would have otherwise been unproblematic, leaving the investigator and department financially exposed; may prompt burdensome government inquiry; and in serious cases may affect their ability to receive government funds through the same or different programs. 7. Departmental Financial Managers should submit cost transfer forms to correct charges on sponsored projects being conducted in their departments. Transfers identified by Research Finance and carried out centrally within Research Finance do not require a Cost Transfer form from a department. Types of transfers initiated within Research Finance (RF) include: 1) transfers between expense categories on the same sponsored project; 2) transfers between two or more years of the same grant, and 3) removal of a deficit from a sponsored project to a contingency fund in the absence of a valid cost transfer request from the department. 8. Adherence to this policy is necessary, as a condition of conducting research at CHB. Investigators are responsible for complying with it, supervising their administrative staff in a manner that ensures that staff understand it and also comply, and seeking assistance from Research Finance where necessary or if they have any questions or concerns. 9. Roles and Responsibilities a. Principal Investigator and Financial Manager i. The Principal Investigator and Financial Manager are responsible for correctly charging costs to the appropriate projects, promptly correcting errors consistent with this policy, and providing an adequate explanation and taking appropriate remedial steps in the first instance to prevent delay in cost transfers. If a change is necessary, the Principal Investigator and/or Financial Manager will complete the appropriate forms as described in the above policy and procedure. b. Financial Analyst (Research Finance) i. The Research Finance office will review, approve and process all appropriate cost transfers. The Financial Analysts in Research Finance office will provide guidance to the research community for interpreting and complying with this policy and procedure. c. Vice President for Research Administration i. The Vice President for Research Administration, or designee, is responsible for evaluating and determining whether to approve requested Late Cost Transfers.",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
Who is responsible for supporting discharge planning and utilization review process on 10NW,0,"The nurse staffing for 10NW includes registered nurses and clinical assistants.

The schedule is then balanced by the time schedulers. They ensure that there is a sufficient mix of staff on each shift. There are dedicated charge nurses on each shift. They provide management of daily unit operations; serve as clinical resource to staff and ensure that the appropriate chain of command is initiated when necessary. Nursing assignments are re-evaluated throughout the day/night using huddles, CAMEO and CHEWS scores. Assignments are changed and rearranged depending on patient acuity, patient care needs and census. The Leadership Group is comprised of Level II and Level III staff nurses who act as clinical leaders and participate in the development, implementation and evaluation of unit goals. The staff is supported by the Nursing Professional Development Practitioners, a Nurse Manager and a Senior Nursing Director and Associate Chief of Nursing. Advanced practice nurses are available in several specialties. The General Surgical patients are covered by general surgery nurse practitioners 24/7. The Case Manager is a Registered Nurse responsible for supporting discharge planning and utilization review process. Hospital supports such as administrative associates, Ascom Smart phone system, environmental services, laboratory, and hospital work stations reduce time away from patient care.","Staffing plans are developed based on the American Nurses Association principles of Nurse Staffing. The principles address patient care unit related, staff related and institution/organization related activities. Patient care related activities reflect the needs of the patients. The staffing plan considers the number of patients and the level of care required while incorporating physical and psychosocial limitations. For staff related activities, the principle needs of the patient populations determine the competencies required of the nurse. Staff skill mix and competencies, as well as leadership and organizational support guide this process. The hospital policies support the needs of patients and nursing staff. The nurse staffing for Waltham Inpatient Surgical Unit includes Registered Nurses and Clinical Assistants/ Administrative Support. The majority of Registered Nurses have several years' experience on one or more of the surgical units at Children's Hospital Boston. Nurses on Waltham Inpatient Surgical Unit work 8 and 12 hour shifts to provide maximum support of the patient flow on the unit. As mainly a surgical unit, many patients are admitted in the afternoon and evening. The combination of 8 and 12 hour shifts provide additional staff during peak times. Unit resources such as administrative associates are considered when planning staffing. The schedule is managed by the Inpatient Clinical Coordinator and Perioperative Nursing Director each shift to ensure appropriate use of staffing resources. The Inpatient Clinical Coordinator or Charge Nurse also provides management of daily unit operations serving as a clinical resource to staff and insuring that appropriate chain of command is initiated when necessary. The staff is supported by the Inpatient Clinical Coordinator, Perioperative Nursing Director and the Executive Director of Patient Care Services Satellites. Additional support for on-going education is provided by Staff Development and Nurse Educators at Children's Hospital Boston. The Patient Care Coordinator who is a Registered Nurse is responsible for supporting discharge planning and the utilization review process for both Longwood [Main] and Waltham campuses.

What is the responsibility of PPSQ in investigating and responding to adverse events and when may this responsibility be delegated to the individual or department reporting the event,0,"Following the identification of an adverse event, the first priority is the mitigation of harm to the patient and appropriate communication with the family. The responsibility for investigating and responding to events resides with PPSQ, but may be delegated to the individual or department reporting the event for events of lower severity and that are not externally reportable. In all cases, the response to an event is dependent upon the nature and severity of the event. Responses to an adverse event may include, but are not limited to: • Activation of the Safety Event Rapid Response Team (SERRT) • Investigation: Initiation of an investigation and causal analysis of events is undertaken by PPSQ staff and/ or local leaders, depending on the nature and severity of the event. The approach seeks to identify system failures that contributed to the adverse event. Techniques employed may include: ◦ Root Cause Analysis (RCA) ◦ Apparent Cause Analysis (ACA) ◦ Clinical practice concerns of an individual clinician (MD or RN) may be referred to the Medical Peer Review or Nursing Peer Review process. Issues identified related to individual trainees will be referred to the appropriate training program director. ◦ When appropriate, relevant patient outcomes and adverse events may also be reviewed at Divisional or Departmental Morbidity and Mortality (M&M) conferences, consistent with the M&M Policy. ADEs are presented and summarized monthly to the Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T) Committee for review and recommendations for action if needed.","[URAC P-PSC 1-3 (a)] A. The goals of this policy are: 1. To have a positive impact in improving patient care; 2. To focus attention on understanding the causes that underlie the event; 3. To reduce the probability of a reoccurrence of the event in the future; and 4. To increase the general awareness and enhance strategies for prevention. B. When an adverse event occurs in a health care organization, it is necessary that the appropriate individuals in leadership positions within the organization be made aware of the event; investigate and understand the causes that underlie the event; and make changes in the organization's systems and processes to reduce the probability of such an event in the future. These leaders are responsible for establishing processes for the identification, reporting, analysis, and prevention of adverse events and for ensuring the consistent and ongoing implementation of a root cause analysis. C. Adverse Events that are subject to review by advisory boards and accrediting bodies include: 1. An occurrence or event which results in an unanticipated death; or 2. An event in which major and permanent loss of function (not related to the natural course of the patient's illness or condition) occurs. D. When such an event occurs the Specialty Pharmacy Manager, or their designee, is expected to prepare a thorough and credible root cause analysis and action plan within forty-five (45) calendar days of the event or of becoming aware of the event. The organization may submit the written analysis and plan to its accrediting body at its discretion and as advised by their legal counsel. E. The responsibility for investigating and responding to events resides with Program for Patient Safety and Quality (PPSQ), but may be delegated to the individual or department reporting the event for events of lower severity and that are not externally reportable. In all cases, the response to an event is dependent upon the nature and severity of the event F. Responses to an adverse event may include, but are not limited to: 1. Activation of the Safety Event Rapid Response Team (SERRT) 2. Investigation: Initiation of an investigation and causal analysis of events is undertaken by PPSQ staff and/or local leaders, depending on the nature and severity of the event. The approach seeks to identify system failures that contributed to the adverse event. Techniques employed may include: a. Root Cause Analysis (ACA) i. The RCA (including internal discussions, analysis, and corrective actions related to clinicians) is considered peer review protected information that is approved by the Senior Clinical Leadership Committee (SCLC). b. Apparent Cause Analysis (RCA) i. E.g. Precursor or Near-Miss events c. Clinical practice concerns of an individual clinician (MD or RN) may be referred to the Medical Peer Review or Nursing Peer Review process. Issues identified related to individual trainees will be referred to the appropriate training program director. d. When appropriate, relevant patient outcomes and adverse events may also be reviewed at Divisional or Departmental Morbidity and Mortality (M&M) conferences, consistent with the M&M Policy. G. If applicable, the Specialty Pharmacy Manager will conduct a root cause analysis which includes the following elements: 1. Focuses primarily on systems and processes, not on individual performance; 2. Progresses from special causes in clinical processes to common causes in organizational processes; 3. Repeatedly digs deeper by asking ""why?"" and then ""why?"" again; 4. Identifies changes which could be made in systems and processes that would reduce the risk of such events occurring in the future; and 5. Is thorough and credible. H. Boston Children’s Specialty Pharmacy, as it provides patient/consumer care in the delivery of medications, utilizes the FDA Med-Watch criteria in establishing its definition and reporting requirement of adverse events. [URAC P-PSC 1-3 (a)] 1. The following are reportable adverse events: a. Death - when a medication causes death or contributed to the death of a patient; b. Life-threatening - when a medication may have resulted in the death of a patient if use of the medication had continued; c. Hospitalization - when the medication caused or contributed to the hospitalization of a patient; d. Disability - when a medication may have caused or contributed to a permanent injury or impairment of the patient; e. Intervention - if medical or surgical intervention was necessary to preclude permanent damage due to the use of the medication. I. Adverse events will be reported to a supervisor or other clinical/administrative leader(s) as well as the hospital’s internal web-based Safety Event Reporting System (SERS) within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. The Specialty Pharmacy Manager will be notified when a reportable adverse event occurs, and appropriate action will be taken. The first priority is mitigation of harm to the patient and the appropriate communication with the family. All adverse events will be reported to the Quality Management Committee for review and analysis.","The following guidelines should be followed to assist in this coordination of efforts. Institutional Review Board 1. Copies of any unanticipated problems for Boston Children's Hospital research subjects submitted to the IRB are also sent to the PPSQ through the electronic protocol review system. 2. These events must be provided to PPSQ and will include any remedial action plans to be taken or already implemented: a. Results that could involve a death of a research subject b. An unexpected or related adverse event c. Medication or laboratory error d. Other serious events, or protocol deviations related to hospital systems 3. The IRB, the IRB Chair, the Institutional Official (Vice President of Research Administration), or the Senior Director of Clinical Research Compliance may request that the PPSQ review an event, series of events, or concerns raised that may impact research subject safety. 4. For any incident reported to the IRB, the IRB may acquire access to any PPSQ documents that may exist regarding the event, including any remedial action plans implemented. 5. The IRB will require that all events that meet the reporting requirements for Safety Event Reporting System (SERS) be submitted through SERS, if not already completed. 6. The IRB will ask for a copy of the SERS report for their files. 7. When incidents rise to the level of required regulatory reporting, the draft report will be submitted to PPSQ for review of accuracy of any information they have regarding the event. Program for Patient Safety and Quality (PPSQ) 1. Any event submitted through SERS that includes the fact that the subject was enrolled on a research protocol should be forwarded to the IRB office. 2. PPSQ may request and ask for information from the IRB office regarding any research protocol for which they have received an event report. PPSQ will be responsive to the requests made by the IRB office as listed above. 3. As appropriate and necessary, both offices will work together and coordinate efforts for resolution of the issues raised and any additional required corrective action plans.","Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) is committed to effectively responding to events that are reported by staff along the continuum from near misses to sentinel events and to promote a culture of safety and transparency. To achieve these goals, Boston Children's Hospital has established policies for the internal reporting, classification, response, external reporting, and disclosure of events. Adverse events and adverse drug events are those defined by this policy, occurring in any location on the BCH licensed premises, consistent with applicable state and federal laws and regulations. The hospital has educational processes in place that encourage the identification and expected reporting of such events by any member of the hospital's staff.","1. The scope of a registered nurse's professional practice includes responsibility for the nature and quality of all nursing care that a patient receives under her/his direction. 2. The registered nurse may delegate the responsibility for the performance of selected patient care activities to assistive personnel who have been oriented and are competent to perform the delegated activity. 3. The registered nurse retains the accountability for the outcome of all delegated activities and therefore, the registered nurse supervises assistive personnel in the performance of delegated activities. 4. The registered nurse uses professional judgement to decide which nursing activities may be delegated, to whom, and under what circumstances. Activities are delegated to assistive personnel based on knowledge of: a. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Nurse Practice Act; b. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Board of Registration in Nursing; c. National standards of nursing practice; and d. The individual patient's clinical need(s).",4,3,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
Why is it important to avoid using the abbreviation SSRI in medicationrelated documentation,0,"Since our patients are ambulatory, it is important to document each of the pleurovac columns during our checks. Documenting the total in each column with each check will correct for output that has tipped into other chambers and will help avoid inaccurate totals. For example, this pleurovac would be documented as ""1230/670/190"" under ""Chest Tube Chamber Level"", as read left to right across the 3 columns.","Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an inherited disorder caused by a genetic defect in the red blood cell enzyme G6PD. Patients with this disorder can develop episodes of acute hemolysis in response to inciting drugs, chemicals, foods, and illnesses. Identification of this population is important during care coordination so anesthesia can avoid aggravating medications during the surgery.","1. A resident or first year fellow is prompted to choose an attending before dictating the first report upon logging in to PowerScribe 360. To select a different attending for a subsequent report, click on Tools > Change Attending . Prior to approving any report please always ensure that you have assigned it to the correct attending in order to avoid having it sit unnoticed in an incorrect Radiologist's queue. 2. Residents and first year fellows dictate reports in PowerScribe 360. If they have not yet reviewed the images with an attending, they save the report by clicking the ""Prelim"" button; if they have reviewed the images with an attending, they approve the report. In either case, the report is sent as a preliminary report via interface to Synapse (the PACS system) and to RadNet (the Radiology Information System). Once in RadNet, the report is available in other downstream systems (PowerChart and other Millennium systems, as well as Nuclear Medicine Viewer). When the first year fellow or resident approves the report, the report is available in the attending radiologist's queue in PowerScribe 360 for final sign-off. Radiologists will not see a report in their queue until it has been approved and assigned to them. 3. Radiologists, Nuclear Medicine Physicians, and second year fellows also dictate reports in PowerScribe 360, but they have the option of signing off their reports immediately in PowerScribe 360, or signing them later from their office or home by connecting to PowerScribe 360 remotely. 4. An attending radiologist is on site 24/7 (Nuclear Medicine, IR & Neuroradiology MR from 7:30am-5pm Mon-Fri only). Nuclear Medicine, IR and Neuro MR have their own resident/fellow call pools. 5. Preliminary reports can be modified as often as necessary. Once a report is final signed by the attending, however, the report can only be modified by adding an addendum to the original report using PowerScribe 360 according to the following policy.","When a patient enters Boston Children's Hospital with a drug supply that is not approved in the United States, it may be considered ""a personal supply of the drug"". 1. This can occur only if the drug is in the possession of the patient. Future supply of the drug must also be through the patient. 2. If more drug is required, it must be shipped directly to the patient and guidance is provided for this situation. It is important that the Boston Children's Hospital physician is aware that when the decision is made to use such a medication, there will be no interaction screening or dose range alerts fired in the Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) system and they will be responsible for monitoring the patient for any adverse effects as part of providing clinical care to the patient.","1. When possible, send muscle and nerve biopsies to the Pathology Department before 3:00pm as they have to be processed on the same day they are collected. 2. Notify the Pathology Department 30 minutes before muscle and nerve biopsies are collected to ensure pathologist has the time to prepare materials for processing of muscle and nerve specimens properly. Do so by: a. Calling the Pathology Assistant in the Surgical Pathology Cutting Room at ext 5-4437. b. If no one is available (and it is before 4:30 PM), call the main pathology number at ext 5-7431. c. After 4:30 PM, page the Neuropathology Fellow on call (Pager #1432). 3. Transport specimens to the Pathology Department as soon as they are prepared to prevent deterioration of the specimens that will occur with a delay of more than 30 minutes. 4. Three biopsies are usually obtained and placed in two separate labeled specimen containers: a. One is placed in a muscle clamp and placed in a specimen container containing a gluteraldehyde solution. b. Two muscle specimens are placed in one specimen container. These muscle specimens remain dry with no solution placed in the container. Note: It is important for the muscle specimen to remain oriented. The segment of pink muscle tissue is not grasped or stretched and is left undisturbed as the surgeon places it on the Telfa™ pad. 5. A nerve biopsy may be submitted with the muscle biopsy. Cover the nerve specimen with saline soaked gauze. Take care to not clamp the specimen; move it by lifting with forceps ONLY at the ends. 6. Label and document the muscle biopsy specimen containers in the same manner as described above in routine specimens. 7. Document the number of and disposition of muscle and nerve biopsy specimens in Surginet. 8. Document the muscle biopsy specimens in the Muscle Biopsy Log using a patient identification label as well as the date, OR room, number and type of specimens and signature of person documenting this information. 9. The circulating nurse delegates the transport of muscle biopsy specimens to the pathology department. The Muscle Biopsy Log is taken by the assigned transporter for the handoff of the specimens. 10. The pathology technician and person transporting the specimen(s) use a visual double-check to verify accuracy of specimen labeling, documentation on the Pathology Request form, and in the Muscle Biopsy Log. 11.

At what age is a newborn infant defined for the purpose of hearing screening according to the hospital policy,1,"Massachusetts defines ""newborn infant"" for purposes of the hearing screen as an infant under three months of age and the term ""hearing screen"" is a test to detect hearing thresholds of 30 decibels or greater in the speech frequency range in either ear. Screening is conducted as soon as the infant is medically stable and prior to initial discharge to home. In exceptional circumstances related to medical acuity as determined by the infant's physician/nurse practitioner (MD/NP), the hearing screen is completed no later than three months of age.","1. Massachusetts requires all newborns to receive a hearing screening by three months of age, unless the parent/guardian objects to a screen based on sincerely held religious beliefs 2. Hearing Screening must occur at the birth hospital before initial discharge to home or at a referring hospital (if the newborn is directly transferred from the birth hospital) before initially discharged to home a. BCH clinicians should obtain and document in the patient's chart information from the transferring hospital if a hearing screen was performed and the results of such screen. If the screen was not successful, missed, or the infant did not pass prior to the transfer, BCH shall conduct the screen prior to initial discharge to home. b. BCH clinicians must notify the parent(s)/guardian(s) both orally and in writing if a heaing screening was not successful, missed, or the infant did not pass. If a repeat or further screening cannot occur prior to discharge, the parent(s)/guardian(s) should be informed in writing of the inability to test prior to discharge, and the following should occur: i. Notify the infant's primary care provider; and ii. An appointment should be made at a DPH approved screening center such as BCH (note based on lack of availability of appointments at available locations, parents can also be provided with a list of sites that conduct such diagnostic screening for their choice). 3. If an infant cannot be screened due to delayed physiological development or physiological instability (related to but not limited to an illness or premature birth) as determined by the treating clinician, the infant shall be screened prior to discharge and as early as the identified physiological development or stability will permit reliable screening. 4. If the infant is discharged to home prior to conducting the hearing screen, an appointment is made for a screen to be performed within 1 month of the infants birth (note based on lack of availability of appointments at available locations, parents can also be provided with a list of sites that conduct such diagnostic screening for their choice). a. The infant's primary care provider should be notified that a hearing screen is pending. Re-screening 5. The Joint Committee on Infant Hearing (JCIH) recommends a repeat hearing screen prior to discharge for infants with conditions/complications associated with potential hearing loss. a. Conditions that warrant re-screening include, but are not limited to, history of ECMO, bilirubin level >20 and/or hyperbilirubinemia requiring an exchange transfusion, gentamicin dosing>72 hrs, furosemide>7 doses, culture-positive sepsis, and meningitis.","1. A newborn infant is deemed a Baby Safe Haven patient if one of the following situations occurs: a. An infant, 7 days of age and younger , is brought to a BCH hospital location by his/her parent who expresses a desire to voluntarily surrender the infant; or b. Someone from another designated facility (an individual who works at a hospital (including a hospital satellite), police station, or manned fire station) transports the infant to the Boston Children's Hospital Emergency Department and reports the baby was voluntarily placed or abandoned at that designated facility.","The MD/NP determines if the infant's hearing screen was completed at the birth hospital. If the infant has not had a hearing screening at the birth hospital or if the infant requires a repeat screen as determined by the guidelines in this policy, the medical team: • informs the parent/legal guardian of the significance of the hearing screenings. • contacts Audiology (ext 5-6461 or via Newborn Hearing Screen Request in EHR) to alert of the need for the screening prior to discharge. The Audiology Assistant performs the hearing screen. The Audiologist: • Reports normal results in patient chart (paper, if applicable, and in EHR) and communicates results to the parent/legal guardian. If the parent/legal guardian is not available, results are conveyed via telephone and/or postal mail. • Reports abnormal results to the medical team and to the parent/legal guardian, and documents results in the EHR. A member of the medical team and/or the audiologist discusses with the parent/legal guardian abnormal results, the result implications, and need for further testing. The Audiologist gives a list of DPH-approved diagnostic test centers to the parent/legal guardian and instructs him/her to make a follow-up diagnostic audiological evaluation appointment at an approved test center. If the infant does not pass the hearing test prior to discharge, the nurse documents that the follow-up appointment has been scheduled on the Newborn Hearing Screening Test Result form located in the ""consults"" section of the patient's chart. • If the follow-up appointment has not been scheduled, the nurse assists the parent/legal guardian with this process and documents the time and date of the appointment on the appropriate line of the form.","1.

The identification of the patient involved 2. The date on which the device was used 3. The reason for the use If a physician in an emergency situation determines the use of a HUD outside of the approved indicated use represents an opportunity to prevent serious harm or death to a patient, a HUD may be used in accordance with the emergency exemption procedures (see emergency exemption policies) This use would need to be reported to the sponsor and the investigator is responsible for all reporting as consistent with emergency use procedures. Use of HUD When There Are No Alternatives in Non-Emergency Situations If an investigator wants to use a HUD outside its approved indication(s) but it is not an emergency situation, the investigator should contact the IRB administrative office for guidance. Investigators will likely need to submit the same information required for an emergency exemption and will also be required to contact the HDE holder prior to use.","• Bypass circuits which have been clear-primed and kept sterile in the pumproom, or moved to the pumproom after having been draped out in the OR, should be saved overnight. A clear-primed circuit can be kept as an emergency pump overnight. The overnight call team is responsible for deciding how to preserve the circuit (arterial head running, membrane gassing, boot removed from arterial head, etc.). A new circuit should be assembled in the morning even if the circuit could have been used for a morning case. This policy is meant to maintain utility of a circuit which may be used for an overnight emergency while at the same time not needlessly introducing patient risk (infection, wetted oxygenator, boot life, etc.).","Labeling and Storage 1. Label milk according to hospital policy – see Breastfeeding Family Education sheet: Instructions for Labeling and Storage of Breastmilk . Drying Tubing 1. Instruct parent to keep breast pump power on: ◦ Disconnect the collection system from the tubing at the breast shield connector and place the tubing over the top of the pump. ◦ Allow the pump to run to air for several minutes. This will eliminate any moisture or condensation that may have collected in the tubing. ◦ Open the top of the Symphony pump and remove the round caps and tubing. ◦ Inspect the tubing for visible soil – if it requires cleaning, wash in soapy water and rinse in cold water. Shake water out. ◦ Reconnect the tubing to the pump and allow pump to run for several minutes until tubing is dry. Note: Moisture is created by the movement of air through the tubing. Dry the tubing to prevent contamination of the tubing with mildew and to decrease the likelihood of contamination of milk. Cleaning 1. Instruct the parent to use disinfectant wipes to clean the outside of the breast pump and any surfaces involved in the process. 2. Take apart all pump kit pieces that touch the milk, including the small yellow valve and white membrane. 3. Place pump kit parts in a hospital wash basin for cleaning. 4.

Patients under 1 year will have both ETCO2 and TCO2 monitoring. Purpose of CO2 monitoring: The purpose of measuring CO2 during pediatric sleep studies is to assess exhaled CO2 levels during sleep and compare that to awake and in between different stages of sleep (REM vs. NREM). As sleep disordered breathing in children can be subtle and there are relatively lesser clear obstructive events, changes in CO2 during breathing may be used to assess the impact of this gas exchange due to changes in breathing pattern. The CO2 is measures by 2 methods: 1. End tidal CO2 : Capnography is the measurement of exhaled carbon dioxide (end tidal CO2) via a numerical measurement (capnography) and the graphical display (capnogram). EtCO2 is used to monitor a patient's ventilatory status and is collected in correlation with all sleep studies. Equipment used for ETCO2 monitoring during sleep study: Philips NM3 7900 Calibration of NM3 machines: The NM3 is calibrated to collection software at the beginning of each sleep study following high, low and align procedure. The NM3 device is also calibrated to zero as required by placing full sample line with cannula in empty room. Signal validation by observing proper squared off waveform as displayed below: ETCO2 wave form analysis : Collection: EtCO2 is collected via nasal cannula placed in nasal nares. For titration studies utilizing nasal or nasal/oral mask EtCO2 is collected via nasal cannula placed under mask in nasal nares. For tracheostomy patients EtCO2 is collected utilizing side stream attachment placed directly on uncapped tracheostomy. Limitation: ETCO2 values can be unreliable if subject does not tolerate nasal cannula, or nasal cannula is blocked by secretions. It can also be inaccurate if patent has mouth breathing. When the child is tachypneic with poor wave forms the CO2 values may be under estimated. Normal Baseline values: 1-12 months 12-24 months 2-12 years > 12 years EtCO2 value 30-40 25-40 35-45 40-50 mmHg 1. All Routine baseline PSG: Using nasal cannula with side stream measurement of CO2 (Preferably ETCO2, but in intolerant to nasal cannula use TcCO2 2. Titration study: We attempt to use nasal cannula under the mask ad use side stream cannula to measure exhaled CO2. If accurate these values may be slightly higher than normal due to dad space created by the mask. If extra leak noted due to mask over nasal cannula, then we use transcutaneous CO2 3. Open tracheotomy studies: Use trach adapter with side stream measurement capability to measure CO2 using NM3 machine. We also use TcCO2 monitoring especially with tracheostomy and ventilation titration.","Cough Assist • Frequency ◦ Initially every 2-4 hours or more frequently for managing de-saturation episodes associated with increased secretions or atelectasis. • Settings as above. The starting inhale pressure will be the same as the set PIP and increased as needed to achieve effectiveness, not exceeding 30 cmH O.

How are Adverse Drug Events ADEs categorized and what are the two main categories for ADEs,0,"Adverse Events are classified using the below criteria: Adverse Event Classifications Level 0 – Near Event was intercepted before reaching the patient. Miss Level 1 – None No harm, no change in condition, may have required monitoring to assess for potential change in condition, no intervention indicated. Level 2 – Minor Transient change in condition, not life threatening, condition returns to baseline, required monitoring, required minor intervention such as holding a medication, obtaining lab test (s), application of heat or cold. Level 3 - Transient change in condition, may be life threatening if not treated, condition Moderate returns to baseline, required monitoring, required intervention such as reversal agent, additional medication, or transfer to ICU. Level 4 - Major Change in condition, life threatening if not treated, change in condition may be permanent, may have required initial or readmit to hospital, may have required transfer to ICU, required monitoring, required major intervention such as invasive procedure Level 5 - Death Catastrophic Note: Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) are categorized as either Preventable Medication Events (Medication Errors) OR Non-preventable Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs)","Adverse Event: harm to a patient resulting from care and treatment, not due to the underlying condition of the patient. For purposes of this definition, we also include errors that reach the patient but do not cause harm. An adverse event, after an internal review by the Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) Program for Patient Safety and Quality, may be further categorized as a ""serious reportable event"" or ""serious incident or accident report"" as defined by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health; a ""sentinel event"" as defined by The Joint Commission; or a ""never event"" as defined by the National Quality Forum. Near Miss Event: Any event or situation that if left undetected or uncorrected may have the potential to cause harm, but did not reach the patient. Adverse Drug Event (ADE): A subset of adverse events that includes medication errors, adverse drug reactions, and drug incompatibilities. Medications include all prescription drug preparations, over the counter (OTC) products, and IV fluids. ADEs encompass harm, or events that require interventions to prevent harm, that result from the use of medications, controlled substances, or pharmaceutical/drug preparation that occur on the hospital premises or are otherwise identified during a patient encounter. ADEs also include adverse drug reaction (ADR), as defined by The National Institute of Health, as a response to a drug that is noxious and unintended, and that occurs at doses used in humans for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or treatment of disease, or for the modification of physiologic function. Apparent Cause Analysis (ACA): A limited investigation of an event performed for selected adverse events that is considered peer review protected information that does not require a full RCA (e.g., Precursor or Near- Miss events). Root Cause Analysis (RCA): A comprehensive, systematic analysis that is performed to identify the causal and contributory factors as well as appropriate corrective actions to prevent a recurrence. The RCA (including internal discussions, analysis, and corrective actions related to clinicians) is considered peer review protected information that is approved by the Senior Clinical Leadership Committee (SCLC). Safety Event Reporting System (SERS): The hospital's electronic data collection repository used for reporting, reviewing, and documenting analysis of events. This includes, but is not limited to, any occurrence of an adverse event, any near miss event, an event or situation that places a patient at increased risk of harm, or unplanned significant change in medical or surgical management not related to the patient's underlying condition. The SERS is a peer review protected system in which any event (including but not limited to adverse events, potential adverse events, and near miss adverse events) are recorded for internal investigation and quality improvement activities. Events reported through SERS are reviewed and classified by the staff of the Program for Patient Safety and Quality (PPSQ) according to definitions and guidelines described in the SERS User Manual. PPSQ determines the classification and preventability of adverse events in collaboration with the local SERS Manager and others within BCH. See Appendix A for further information on adverse event classification. Information in the SERS system is privileged and peer review protected. SERS data and all reports generated from the SERS is intended only for internal review within Boston Children's for quality improvement activities. Without prior review and approval, SERS reports are not available for research or general publication externally to Boston Children's Hospital. Safety Event Rapid Response Team (SERRT): In the case of a severe event (actual or near miss), that, in the opinion of the Chief Patient Safety and Quality Officer, or his/her delegate, constitutes an active threat to patient safety, a multidisciplinary team may be convened immediately to review the event, begin an initial investigation, and implement immediate corrective actions.","[URAC P-PSC 1-3 (a)] It is Boston Children’s Hospital policy to treat suspected or potential adverse reactions as adverse reactions, therefore the same procedure would be followed for both. A. A standardized reporting mechanism will be employed: 1. All ADEs will be referred to the Specialty Pharmacy Manager for appropriate follow-up; 2. Adverse event reporting will be documented through the hospital’s internal web-based Safety Event Report System (SERS) within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. a.

Why is there uncertainty regarding the causal association between red blood cell transfusions and NEC in neonates,0,"• There is uncertainty regarding the casual association between RBC transfusions and NEC. • Until further evidence is available and best practice is established, it is reasonable to withhold feeds during RBC transfusions in neonates at higher risk of NEC.","Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious inflammatory condition of the intestine that affects up to 10% of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. 1 Many factors contribute to the development of NEC but the exact pathogenesis is not clear. Transfusion-associated NEC (TANEC) or transfusion associated gut injury (TRAGI) refers to NEC episodes that are temporally related (within 48 hours) to RBC transfusion. 2,3 TANEC is estimated to account for 20-35% of NEC episodes, 4 and compared to infants with NEC unrelated to RBC transfusion, TANEC is associated with increased need for surgical intervention, longer hospitalization, and higher mortality. 3,5,6 Several mechanisms for TANEC have been proposed including severe anemia leading to impaired blood flow to the gut, exposure to immunological mediators in transfused blood that trigger an immune reaction, and ischemia/reperfusion injury associated with RBC transfusion. 7,8 Multiple meta-analyses over the past 10 years have attempted to determine the association between RBC transfusions and NEC with conflicting results. 6,9-11 In addition, subsequent clinical and pre-clinical studies have suggested that both the severity of anemia and the RBC transfusion together increase the risk of TANEC. 2,12,13 Due to the uncertainty regarding the casual association of RBC transfusion and NEC, many NICUs have adopted the practice of holding enteral feeds peri-transfusion in hopes of minimizing any potential risk of developing TANEC. Over the past ~7 years multiple observational studies and one small randomized controlled trial (RCT) have been performed to investigate the association between feeding during RBC transfusion and the risk of developing TANEC. The findings from these studies are conflicting and with limitations [ see table in related content for full descriptions ]. The Withholding Enteral Feeds Around packed RBC Transfusion (WHEAT) point of care pilot trial has finished initial enrollment at two centers in the UK and may expand to a larger, multicenter trial pending analysis of feasibility outcomes. This study randomized infants born at <30 weeks gestational age to continue enteral feeds (per unit guideline) during transfusion or hold enteral feeds 4 hours before, during, and 4 hours after transfusion until a post menstrual age of 34+6 weeks. Clinical outcomes (including severe NEC, spontaneous intestinal preformation, all-cause mortality, duration of parenteral nutrition, number of days with central venous line, number of line associated blood stream infection, and growth) will be assessed from randomization to 40+0 weeks of gestation, or unit discharge, whichever occurs first. This trial should provide further information to guide feeding practices during RBC transfusions. The wide variation in the currently available evidence and available feeding protocols makes it difficult to determine the best feeding practices around and during RBC transfusions. Stopping enteral feedings is not without risk (prolonging time to reach full milk feeds which is associated with infection and can also be associated with increased risk of NEC). Until further evidence is available, it is reasonable to implement enteral feeding guidelines similar to those under investigation in the WHEAT trial.","Neonatal anemia is common, and all neonates (both term and preterm) experience a decrease in hemoglobin (Hb) during their physiological adaptation to the relative oxygen-rich extrauterine environment. The Hb usually drops from 14-22 to 10-12 g/dl by 2-3 months of age in term infants (termed physiological anemia of infancy). However, in preterm neonates, the Hb drops more rapidly and steeply (termed anemia of prematurity) due to additional physiological (i.e. lower levels of and decreased responsiveness to erythropoietin, shorter RBC life, higher growth rate), pathophysiological (i.e. infection, hemolysis, impaired red cell production) and iatrogenic factors (phlebotomy losses). 1,2 Due to these factors, red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is one of the most common therapies administered in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). A recent large retrospective cohort study of neonatal transfusion practices in the U.S. found that approximately 70% of all neonates with a gestational age <27 weeks will receive at least one RBC transfusion during their NICU stay, with an average number of transfusions per patient of 4.7. 3 Several studies have shown that RBC transfusion in neonatal anemia improves cardiac output and tissue oxygenation, 4-7 decreases the number of apneic episodes, 8-11 and improves blood pressure in mechanically ventilated preterm infants. 12 Currently, the hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) remain the most commonly used laboratory values to determine which neonates would benefit from transfusion, with low values interpreted as markers of diminished oxygen carrying capacity and impaired tissue oxygenation that could be improved with transfusion. Optimal tissue oxygenation is particularly important in neonates because of the rapidly developing and growing body, especially the brain, but whether or not the Hct and Hb are the best metrics to evaluate tissue oxygenation (and guide transfusion practices) remains unclear and is an area of ongoing research. 13-17 Despite reports of benefit in the neonatal population, RBC transfusions are not risk-free. In addition to the known general risks of RBC transfusions (i.e. transfusion-related acute lung injury, transfusion-associated circulatory overload, excessive iron load, hemolytic transfusion reactions, and infections), transfusions given to preterm infants have been associated with increases in systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines, 18-20 bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). 21,22 Multiple observational studies investigating the association between transfusion and NEC have implicated severe anemia, RBC transfusion, or both in its pathogenesis, but meta-analyses of the data are conflicting in their findings. 23-26 Investigating the association between anemia and development of NEC, a recent prospective study of 598 very low birth weight infants found that infants with severe anemia (Hb≤8 g/dL) had significantly increased rates of NEC compared to those without severe anemia. 27 Similarly, a case-control study of 333 premature infants with NEC found a 10% increase risk of NEC for every 1 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin nadir in multivariate modeling. 28 Preclinical models suggest that both the degree of anemia and the RBC transfusion together contribute to transfusion-associated necrotizing enterocolitis, but this remains an area of active clinical and preclinical research. 29,30 The Hb level at which the benefits of a RBC transfusion outweigh the risks in a preterm infant is unknown. This issue is further complicated by the fact that oxygen consumption may be higher in critically ill compared to stable neonates, and that the level of fetal hemoglobin decreases with advancing postnatal age, which affects the oxygen delivery at the tissue level. 31 These factors strongly suggest that different transfusion thresholds should be used at different times after birth, and for different levels of respiratory support. In total, four randomized controlled trials have been published comparing different hemoglobin (or hematocrit) levels as triggers for transfusion (restrictive vs. liberal strategies) in neonates born < 32 weeks, taking into account postnatal age and level of respiratory support. The first two of these trials (the Iowa trial and the PINT study) reported short-term outcomes, 32,33 with follow-up studies looking at long-term outcomes, such as brain volume, cerebral palsy and cognitive function. 34-36 Both studies reported fewer transfusions in the low- threshold groups, but none of the pre-defined short-term outcomes were different between the two treatment groups. The long term follow up outcomes were strikingly different in the two studies, however: the Iowa study (which had a significant drop-out rate, 44%) favored the restrictive transfusion practices according to the 12 year neurocognitive and neuroradiological follow-up, while the PINT trial (93% follow-up rate) found improved cognitive function in the liberal transfusion group at 18-21 months of age. As a consequence of these discrepant findings and in the absence of local guidelines, RBC transfusions were administered to neonates mostly based on physicians’ preferences, leading to large variations in treatment practices until the recent publication of the TOP and ETTNO trials in 2020. These larger trials compared restrictive and liberal transfusion thresholds in premature infants and found no differences between the groups in the primary outcome of death or neurodevelopmental impairment at 24 months of age. 37,38 In contrast to prior observational studies, these trials found no increase in complications of prematurity (including bronchopulmonary dysplasia and necrotizing enterocolitis) in infants transfused more liberally. However, the neurodevelopmental outcomes evaluated in both RCTs measured severe deficits and so it remains unclear whether RBC transfusions (or anemia) are associated with more subtle neurodevelopmental problems (i.e. attention deficits) that manifest later in life. A school-age follow up study of infants in the TOP trial is in progress, and will answer this question. Regarding transfusion volume, studies suggest that larger transfusion volumes (15-30 ml/kg) may be beneficial and reduce the number of transfusions and donor exposures. 39-41 The biggest cohort study comparing 15 vs. 20 ml/kg RBC transfusion volumes in neonates <32 weeks gestation favored 15 ml/kg in infants <28 weeks gestation, and 20 ml/kg in neonates ≥28 weeks gestation, resulting in reduced donor exposure. 41","• Currently available data from randomized controlled trials of red cell transfusion thresholds only includes infants < 32 weeks (or with a birth weight <1500g) until PMA of 36 weeks and little to no data is available to guide transfusion decisions in infants born outside of these parameters. • Low hemoglobin is commonly interpreted as a marker of diminished carrying capacity and impaired 2 tissue oxygenation ◦ Particularly important in neonates with developing and growing body • Besides the general risks (transfusion associated lung injury, transfusion associated circulatory overload, excessive iron load, infection, hemolytic reactions), transfusions may carry further risks in preterms. • consumption may be higher in critically ill compared with stable neonates. 2 • Thresholds for RBC transfusion used in local guidelines should be within the thresholds used across clinical trials - the safety of these thresholds is established. • The best available evidence to date, from the TOP and ETTNO trials, suggest there to be no difference in survival without neurodevelopmental impairment at 22 to 26 months of age between infants transfused at higher hemoglobin transfusion thresholds compared to lower. The proposed guidelines are within the ranges used in the TOP and ETTNO studies for those specific populations studied in the trials. • These guidelines DO NOT apply to cases of acute bleeding or anticipated bleeding (perioperative).","Manual Exchange A manual procedure in which a patient's blood is replaced by repeatedly Transfusion removing and replacing small aliquots of blood over a short period of time. Donor whole blood or blood component that has been re-suspended to a specific hematocrit using compatible fresh frozen plasma may be used. This procedure removes partially hemolyzed and antibody-coated red blood cells as well as unattached antibodies, bilirubin and leukocytes and replaces them with donor red blood cells lacking the sensitizing antigen and plasma containing normal concentrations of bilirubin and lacking pathogenic antibodies. A manual whole blood exchange is usually considered the safest and most rapid approach to therapeutically remove red blood cells, plasma, and leukocytes from neonates and infants.",1,0,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

It is important to note that the court order can grant either : (1) a ""Partial Emancipation"" to allow the minor to make decisions about themselves, but still be entitled to financial support from the parents (most common); or (2) ""Complete Emancipation"" to allow minor to make any decision about themselves (NOT common). ◦ Regardless of emancipation, a minor may also be determined to be a ""mature minor"" who can consent to their own health care without parental involvement or consent, only under the following circumstances: ▪ Married, widowed, or divorced; ▪ Pregnant or believes herself to be pregnant; ▪ A parent of a child (he/she may also give consent for the medical/dental care of the child); ▪ Enlisted in the military on a full-time active duty basis; ▪ Living separate and apart from parents or a legal guardian and is managing their own financial affairs; ▪ Reasonably believes they have contracted a disease dangerous to the public health, and they seek treatment for such disease; ▪ Seeking their own treatment for: drug addiction (provided that they are at least 12 years old and two or more physicians determined the child is drug dependent), family planning services, or treatment for sexually transmitted diseases (including HIV or AIDS); or ▪ Seeking to voluntarily commit themselves for mental health treatment without parental consent (provided they are at least 16 years of age). Note: Consents by a mature minor are confidential. Parent/guardians should not be informed about the procedure unless: (1) the provider reasonably believes that the minor's condition is dangerous to life or limb; or (2) the minor agrees. Such agreements must be documented in the patient's medical record. If the mature minor's parent and/or guardian is not notified, make sure that the finance office is also notified, so confidentiality is maintained and special payment arrangements are put into place if necessary.","Emancipated a child who obtained a court order to end the rights and responsibilities of the parent Minor and can make their own decisions. Mature Minor who under common law rules has a specific situation that allows them to consent to their own health care without parental involvement. The specific situations incudes minors who are: married, widowed, or divorced; pregnant; parent of a child; enlisted in the military; or who reasonably believes they have contracted a disease dangerous to the public health.","For children residing in Massachusetts, there are two methods by which the Department of Children and Families (DCF) may be involved with a family. Only the first method (outlined below) will impact the process for obtaining consent to enroll into a research study (as documented in state regulations 110 CMR 11.23, and state policy (DCF Policy #91-005, revised 07/08/2008)): 1. The first method is a Care and Protection (C&P), where DCF has obtained legal custody through a permanent or temporary order and must provide the consent for enrollment in a research study. This includes the following considerations: a. If the child is still residing with the parents or with family members, the study must obtain consent from the DCF social worker managing the case. The DCF social worker has authority through state regulations as the legally authorized representative of DCF to consent for care and treatment as well as enroll in a research study. b. If the child is in foster care, the study must also obtain consent from the DCF social worker managing the case, who is the legally authorized representative on behalf of DCF. Please note that foster parents cannot provide consent unless they have a specific delegation of authority from DCF (which is rarely provided). Researcher should also be aware that if DCF has started the court process for removal of parental rights, then DCF will seek court approval prior to allowing the child to be enrolled that may delay obtaining consent to participate. 2. The second method that DCF may be involved with a family is a Child Requiring Assistance (CRA), where DCF is providing general assistance to a family to assist with the care needs of the child. a. In a CRA, parents retain legal custody and only they can provide the consent for medical decisions and/or enrollment into a research study. b. The research study does NOT need to obtain an additional consent from DCF. 3. If there is a question as to how DCF is involved with a family for the purposes of obtaining consent to enroll in a study, please contact the Boston Children's Hospital Office of General Counsel to review any paperwork regarding DCF involvement. For children residing in another state who are in state custody of that respective state, the research study can also contact the Boston Children's Hospital Office of General Counsel if assistance is needed to review any applicable paperwork from the state agency to determine who can provide consent for enrolling into a research study.","The following IRB guidelines for pregnancy testing are implemented as part of a research protocol: 1. An investigator's plan for pregnancy testing is to be consistent with the clinical guidelines unless a justified exception is approved by the IRB and the Department Chair or Division Chief. 2. Protocols may not exclude persons based upon their potential to bear children. There must be justified, scientific rationale to exclude persons of childbearing potential. 3. Massachusetts law requires that a positive pregnancy test result be communicated only to the minor and not to their parents without permission. This includes pregnancy test results obtained during the course of research. 4. The IRB sets an age criterion of 12 years or the onset of menses, as a requirement for pregnancy testing in protocols that may potentially affect a fetus. a. If an investigator proposes to perform pregnancy testing for children under the age of 12 or before the onset of menses, the investigator must justify why this is appropriate for the protocol. b. In determining whether it is acceptable to perform pregnancy testing before age 12 or the onset of menses, the IRB considers the potential for direct benefit offered by the protocol within the context of the research. 5. Adolescents under the age of 12 : For subjects under the age of 12 (if required by the protocol), the investigator is to use their discretion as to the subject's knowledge of and exposure to sexual activities in order to determine whether a separate document is reasonable. 6. Adolescents age 12 and older : The IRB strongly recommends that investigators consider the use of a separate document for adolescents age 12 and older, even when assent is not required by the adolescent. This document is to address pregnancy testing and the need to avoid pregnancy only. 7. Any plan for pregnancy testing must be fully disclosed in the informed consent document. The consent is to include: a. The type of pregnancy testing (blood or urine). b. The frequency of testing (prior to the trial, during, both). c. What will happen if results are positive? d. Who will be informed of the results? e. How confidentiality will be maintained? Sample consent form template language describing pregnancy testing is available.",4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

It is imperative that any accepting unit be given these guidelines and understands the plan of care. • Make a referral early in the hospital stay to the Case Manager. • Infants require a pulse oximeter at home for at least 3 months. Oximeter settings 90-100% are used when infant is sleeping or unmonitored. Oxygen standby is not needed, unless it is determined to be necessary during the hospital stay. • Refer to VNA for weight checks, feeding assistance, and adhesion checks. • If nasogastric tube in place, teach parents about nasogastric feeds, nasogastric tube placement, etc. Typical options for NG placement are: placement by parents, and/or VNA, and/or pediatrician, and/or local ER.

According to the Synergy Professional Model of Care how are patients assigned to nurses based on their individual competencies and patient needs,0,"Our model of care delivery is the Synergy Model - we match patient/family needs to a nurse's level of expertise. The Synergy Model describes a patient-nurse relationship that supports the primacy of patients and families. All nurse-patient/family assignments are based upon matching patient/family needs to nurse competencies . The Synergy Model describes a cluster of individual characteristics that each patient and family brings to a healthcare situation. These 8 characteristics span a continuum of health to illness and include: stability, complexity, vulnerability, predictability, resiliency, participation in decision-making, participation in care, and resource availability (see Operational Definitions below). Nursing competencies, derived from the needs of patients, are also described in terms of essential continuums. The Synergy Model describes eight dimensions of nursing practice that span the continuum from competent nurse to expert nurse. These include clinical judgment, clinical inquiry, caring practices, response to diversity, advocacy/moral agency, facilitation of learning, collaboration and systems thinking (see Operational Definitions below). These competencies reflect a dynamic integration of knowledge, skills, experience, and attitudes needed to meet patient's needs and optimize patient outcomes. Our professional advancement program is based upon evolving expertise within these eight dimensions of practice.","The model of care used is the Synergy Model . This model of care matches individual nurse competencies and the patient needs when assigning patients. In the ED, the primary focus is providing continuity of care with a family-centered approach. Patients have their care coordinated on a shift by shift basis by an appropriately experienced RN. Unit and hospital wide Patient Care Manual in conjunction with Emergency Services Patient Care Manual for the management of patients are used, evaluated and updated when appropriate. In the ED, nurses can be assigned to different roles including triage, flo-coordinator, charge nurse, site manager, and team nursing. Physician (MD) staffing is also done according to the team system with the goal of matching MD and RN assignments as much as possible, and creating systems and structures that support communication, collaboration and minimize unnecessary handoffs.","The model of care used is the Synergy Model (Professional Model of Care). This model of care matches individual nurse competencies and the patient needs when assigning patients. On 7 West the primary focus is providing continuity of care within a family-centered approach. Patients with lengths of stay over 48 hours are assigned a team of nurses who are responsible for overall coordination of care and discharge planning throughout the patient's stay. The nurse communicates with a team of nurses who provide continuity of care. Patients with shorter lengths of stay have their care coordinated on a shift basis by an appropriately experienced RN. Nursing care is consistent with the Massachusetts Nurse Practice Act, ANA standards, and the standards and policies and procedures of the Department of Nursing. Unit and hospital wide guidelines and protocols for the management of patients are used, evaluated and updated when appropriate. Shared governance is a model utilized on the unit and staff are supported to attend committee meetings.","The American Nurses Association's (ANA, 2020) Principles for Nurse Staffing provides a foundation which influences unit-staffing patterns to ensure safe and comprehensive patient care. These principles include the characteristics and considerations of the healthcare consumer, the registered nurses, and other inter- professional team members and staff. The staffing plan considers the MFCC patient needs and interventions and the resources required to deliver the necessary level of care to each patient. Other influencing factors include the organizational approach to the delivery of nursing care services and the practice environment on the delivery of care (ANA, 2020). Therapies, services, and activities related to patient care reflect the needs of the patient and their families with consideration for any physical and psychosocial limitations. The principle needs of the patient population influence and determine the competencies required for safe nursing practice on an ongoing basis. Unit and hospital based leadership provide added structure and guidance in the development of competencies which are evaluated on a regular basis. Additionally, the hospital maintains policies, which are also reviewed on a routine basis, that support the needs and safety of patients and nursing staff. The Synergy Professional Model of Care guides patient care delivery. This model of care matches individual nurse competencies and the patient needs when assigning patients. All nursing care meets the requirements of the Massachusetts Nurse Practice Act, American Nurses' Association standards and the standards and policies and procedures set forth by Children's Hospital Boston Department of Nursing.

When should a nurse contact the Medical Control Physician regarding patients with cardiac arrhythmias,0,"Contact the Medical Control Physician for the following: • Patients with cardiac arrhythmias who are not significantly hemodynamically compromised, or who have types of rhythm disturbances other than those listed above. • If the cardiac rhythm disturbance persists despite cardioversion or defibrillation attempts. • Patient with an AICD that has failed or is malfunctioning.","1. Once a Transport Team request has been initiated, the following criteria are used to determine the most appropriate Medical Control Physician to triage the CCTT request and determine the most appropriate mode of transport. 2. For each hospital service listed, the physician indicated should be contacted for all CCTT transports for patients meeting the designated criteria. a. Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) – Fellow i. Confirmed cardiac diagnosis (any age) ii. If diagnosis unconfirmed, defer to age-based criteria with exception below iii. Failed congenital heart disease screening in a symptomatic infant with high likelihood of critical congenital cardiac disease determined through the CICU and NICU fellow conference call (with respective attending involvement in decision-making) iv. Exception: premature infant with a Patent Ductus Ateriosus (PDA) – refer to the NICU b. Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) – Fellow i. Age: patients under 1 month of age (regardless of gestational age) ii. Age: all patients less than 44 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) iii. Premature infant with a PDA iv. Failed congenital heart disease screening in a well infant without local echo v. Failed congenital heart disease screening in a symptomatic infant with low likelihood of critical congenital cardiac disease determined through CICU and NICU fellow conference call (with respective attending involvement in decision-making) vi. Patient is older than 1 month of age but currently in a NICU vii. Exception: diagnosis of CDH – refer to MSICU regardless of age c. Medical-Surgical Intensive Care Unit (MSICU) – Fellow i. Age: patients over 1 month of age ii. Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) d. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (NICU) – Attending Neonatologist i. Referring MD requests transport to the Beth Israel NICU in particular e. ECMO Referrals (Not mobile ECMO request) i. Neonatal (age <1 month): NICU 1. Exceptions: CDH (defer to MSICU) and congenital heart disease (refer to CICU) 2. Inquire whether or not therapeutic hypothermia has been initiated 3. Ensure the NICU attending has been notified and that he/she has discussed the case with the MSICU attending ii. Pediatric (age >1 month): MSICU 3. Medical control for trauma and surgical cases is also based on the above criteria. a. For cases where the Emergency Department is the most appropriate destination, the MCP should give a report to the accepting (ED) attending. b. Additionally, the MCP should give report via the recorded line to the accepting attending for any location other than the ICU where the MCP is based. c. For transports originating with the ED attending, the above criteria should be used to determine medical control and the ED attending should be connected to the appropriate MCP to give a report. The ICU will then assume medical control and can contact the referring facility for further details if needed.","1. Referring physician contacts Children's Transport Team via the Communications Center (866-771-KIDS or 617-355-2170) 2. The referring physician requests the Team for transport from the community facility to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center NICU. 3. The Communications Specialists (CS) will take the initial information per policy. a. See 04.04 Initiating a Transport Team Request 4. The Communications Center will then contact the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Neonatologist on the recorded line by calling 617-667-4042 (Main Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center NICU #) and conferencing in the referring physician. 5. The Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Neonatologist will take the necessary information and provide pre-transport advice as necessary, and will serve as the Medical Control Physician for the transport (except as noted below). 6. The Communications Center will then conference the Children's Transport Team with the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Neonatologist for further information about the transport. It is very important that the neonatologist clearly convey the following: a. Availability of a bed at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center NICU b. Urgency of transport (useful when the Team is getting multiple calls) c. Need for specialized equipment/medications on transport d. Any other special considerations 7. In the event the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Neonatologist determines that the patient should be transported to Boston Children's Hospital rather than Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center NICU (e.g. need for ECMO, congenital heart disease, surgical emergency), the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center's Neonatologist should contact the Communications Center as soon as it becomes apparent. The Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Neonatologist should provide a report to the appropriate fellow (NICU, MSICU, CICU), who will then serve as the Medical Control Physician for the remainder of the transport. 8. In the event that the Children's Transport Team determines that a baby will need the specific services of Children's Hospital rather than Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center NICU, the Team should contact the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Neonatologist to update him/her on the change in status, and notify the Communications Center. 9. The Communications Center will then contact the appropriate Children's Hospital unit to establish availability of a bed for the baby, and will facilitate contact between the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Neonatologist and Children's fellow to transmit clinical information. At this point, the Children's fellow will become the Medical Control Physician.","1. Usually found in patients with pre-existing conduction defects. May be found subcutaneously in the infraclavicular area or in the abdomen. 2. Malfunction may lead to failure to pace or failure to be inhibited by native cardiac conduction. 3. Whenever possible, obtain a 12-lead ECG at the referring hospital for review by the cardiology service. DO NOT DELAY transport to obtain a 12-lead ECG; instead, it is acceptable to record tracings from limb leads (I, II, and III). 4. In addition to usual patient history, obtain the following information if able: a. Pacemaker type and programmed settings – see Appendix 1: Implantable Pacemaker/ AICD Nomenclature Information Sheet b. Date of last battery change c. Name and contact information of patient's EP Cardiologist d. Pertinent history that may be contributory to pacemaker malfunction (i.e.: hit in the chest area of implant, exposure to power source) 5. For known or suspected pacemaker failure, prepare for transthoracic pacing by placing pacing electrodes in the anterior-posterior position. Do not place the electrodes over the pacemaker box. Consult with the Medical Control Physician regarding the initiation of transthoracic pacing and settings (rate and energy). Record the ECG after initiation of pacing (twelve-lead or limb leads, depending on availability) and document correlation with palpable pulse. 6. For known or suspected pacemaker malfunction with failure to be inhibited, prepare for transthoracic pacing by placing pacing electrodes in the anterior-posterior position. Do not place the electrodes over the pacemaker box. With authorization from the Medical Control Physician, place a magnet over the pacemaker box to disable it. The magnet should be kept in place for the duration of the transport. Be prepared to initiate transthoracic pacing if native cardiac rate or cardiac output is inadequate. 7. Strong electrical fields may interfere with implanted pacemaker performance. Precautions to be taken in the transport environment include: a. Cell phones should be kept > 6 inches from patient's implant site. b. Patient should not be subjected to MRI or radiation therapy doses of radiation. Dosing used for plain radiographs is permissible. c. Airport metal detectors may be set off by the device and hand wands may interfere with device performance. Team members should request a hand search of any patient with an implanted pacemaker who needs to clear airport security.","• The Transport Nurse will give both a nursing report to the receiving nurse on the admitting ward/unit as well as a report to the receiving physician for the accepting hospital service. The Critical Care Transport Team (CCTT) can admit to all inpatient units at Boston Children's Hospital without restrictions based on day or time. • Purpose: The Critical Care Transport Team has assessed the patient on behalf of the Medical Control Physician (MCP), and in conjunction with the MCP has determined the appropriate admitting ward/unit. The Transport Nurse gives a report to both the receiving nurse and physician in order to provide the most recent clinical assessment to the receiving staff.

Access • For the dialysis treatment to be successful, adequate vascular access is required. • The goal is to choose the largest double lumen catheter that can be placed. ◦ In neonates, if a true double lumen catheter cannot be placed, then umbilical vessels can be used for access. ◦ A 5 Fr. catheter can be placed in the umbilical artery and a 7-8 Fr. catheter in the umbilical vein. ◦ The tip of the UVC should be located above the diaphragm. ◦ The tip of the UAC should be below the renal arteries. • Potential sites for double lumen catheter access include the femoral, internal jugular, and subclavian veins. • The smallest double lumen catheter that can be used is 7 Fr. 10cm (IJ or Subclavian). The preferred catheter size for infants is an 8 Fr. 11 cm catheter. This catheter size is less apt to kink and will maintain the ordered blood flow. • After catheter placement the tip of the dialysis catheter should be in the proximal right atrium and placement should be confirmed by x-ray or by fluoroscopy",-1,-1,-1,-1,,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
What are the indications for performing synchronized cardioversion and defibrillation in a clinical setting,1,Transport nurse specialists and transport paramedics are authorized to perform synchronized cardioversion and defibrillation on patients with cardiac rhythm disturbances and unstable hemodynamics according to the indications above.,"1. Assess ABCs. Perform airway management according to the CCTT Airway Management protocol and initiate oxygen therapy or positive-pressure ventilations with 100% oxygen according to the CCTT Respiratory Distress/Failure protocol . If the patient is pulseless, initiate chest compressions according to the current American Heart Association Basic Life Support guidelines. 2. Obtain vascular access but do not delay electrical therapy. 3. Perform synchronized cardioversion or defibrillation as indicated using the following energy levels according to the current American Heart Association Pediatric Advanced Life Support guidelines: a. Cardioversion: 0.5 - 1 J/kg; if unsuccessful, double and repeat at 1 - 2 J/kg. b. Defibrillation (biphasic): 2 J/kg (maximum 120 J if using Zoll X series). If unsuccessful, attempt defibrillation at 4J/kg (maximum 200 J if using Zoll X series). For third and subsequent attempts use at least 4 J/kg, up to a maximum of 10 J/kg or 200 J (if using Zoll X series). 4. Apply the appropriate-sized paddles/pads in the standard sterno-apical configuration or use the anterior- posterior technique. 5. Use conductive gel or pre-gelled defibrillation pads. 6. For patients who are responsive, consider providing sedation according to the CCTT Analgesia and Sedation protocol. 7. Following cardioversion, reassess the cardiac rhythm. Following defibrillation, resume chest compressions immediately for approximately two minutes until reassessing cardiac rhythm and pulse. 8. Document a recording of the ECG before and after each event. 9. Maintain patient and team member safety during energy delivery. 10. Follow the American Heart Association Pediatric or Adult Advanced Life Support algorithms for further care.","1. May be found in patients with prior life-threatening episodes of ventricular arrhythmias. Capable of delivering a number of therapies including: a. Anti-tachycardia (""overdrive"") pacing b. Single or dual chamber pacing for bradycardia c. Cardioversion d. Defibrillation e. Adaptive rate sensors 2. AICDs are usually implanted subcutaneously in the abdomen or left chest. 3. Malfunction may lead to failure to defibrillate in the presence of an abnormal rhythm, or administration of countershocks when not indicated. 4. Whenever possible, obtain a 12-lead ECG at the referring hospital for review by the cardiology service. DO NOT DELAY transport to obtain a 12-lead ECG; instead, it is acceptable to record tracings from limb leads (I, II, and III). 5. In addition to usual patient history, obtain the following information if able: a. Device capabilities and programmed settings – see Appendix 1: Implantable Pacemaker/ AICD Nomenclature Information Sheet b. Date of last battery change c. History of delivered shocks in recent past d. Name and contact information for patient's EP Cardiologist e. Pertinent history that may be contributory to ICD malfunction (i.e.: hit in the chest area of implant, exposure to power source) 6. For patients with AICD failure and presence of a rhythm for which defibrillation or cardioversion is indicated, perform defibrillation or cardioversion using the energy doses provided above in the Cardioversion and Defibrillation section. Avoid placing the defibrillator paddles/ pads over the AICD device. 7. For patients with AICD malfunction who are receiving defibrillations that are not indicated, consult with the Medical Control Physician. With authorization from the Medical Control Physician, place a magnet over the AICD to disable it. The magnet should be kept in place for the duration of the transport. Be prepared to perform transthoracic defibrillation or cardioversion if indicated. Do not place the defibrillator paddles/ pads over the AICD device. 8. Strong electrical fields may interfere with AICD performance. Precautions to be taken in the transport environment include: a. Cell phones should be kept > 6 inches from patient's implant site. b. Patient should not be subjected to MRI or radiation therapy doses of radiation. Dosing used for plain radiographs is permissible. c. Airport metal detectors may be set off by the device and hand wands may interfere with device performance. Team members should request a hand search of any patient with an AICD who needs to clear airport security.","• Cardioversion is a timed, electrical shock delivered by a defibrillator that is synchronized to discharge during the down slope of the R wave or with the S wave. Elective cardioversion is performed most commonly for atrial arrhythmias such as atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation.","The ideal location of a CVC tip is at the SVC/RA junction in upper extremity and neck lines and at the IVC/RA junction for lower extremity lines. However, placement of the catheter tip into the RA may be acceptable for dialysis and other high-flow indications if adequate flows cannot be established with the tip at the SVC/RA junction. The acceptable location for a CVC catheter tip in patients ≤3 months old (corrected age) is anywhere in the SVC or IVC, but not in the RA unless this is required for high-flow indications (e.g., dialysis) and adequate flows cannot be established at the SVC/RA junction. Other than for high-flow indications, catheters should generally not be left in the RA due to a high risk of line-related complications, and due to the (potentially) high degree of line position variation within the RA during movement and positioning. The acceptable location for a CVC catheter tip in patients >3 months old (corrected age) is anywhere in the SVC, IVC, or in the proximal RA. The proximal RA may be preferable in high-flow indications (e.g., pheresis, dialysis) when inadequate or inconsistent flow is encountered at the SVC/RA junction during intraoperative assessment during placement. Indications for removing the line from the RA include arrhythmia, or radiographic findings that suggest either deformation of the atrial wall by the catheter or projection through the tricuspid valve.",-1,-1,-1,-1,,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1

It is through multiple interactions with patients and their families that nurses learn what is most important to the patient and family. Response to diversity involves the ability to recognize, appreciate and incorporate differences in the provision of care. Differences may include, but are not limited to, individuality, culture, spiritual beliefs, gender, race, ethnicity, family configuration, lifestyle, socioeconomic status, age, values and the use of alternative medical therapies. Nurses help families identify what is important to them as individuals and support them though difficult situations. The model of care used is the Synergy Model (Professional Model of Care). This model of care matches individual nurse competencies to patient needs when assigning patients. Nursing care is consistent with the Massachusetts Nurse Practice Act, ANA standards, and the standards and policies and procedures of the Department of Nursing. Unit and hospital wide guidelines and protocols for the management of patients are used, evaluated and updated when appropriate. Guidelines for age specific care are used. All nurses are introduced to age- specific care needs during orientation and are responsible for these competencies each year during their performance appraisals. Age specific competencies range from the neonate to the adult. Through collaboration with other disciplines such as physical therapy, occupational therapy and child life these developmental needs are met.

How does the OPS collaborate with primary care pediatric and specialty pediatric care providers as well as community behavioral clinicians in delivering behavioral health care services,0,"Entry into the OPS begins with a diagnostic evaluation , which is a comprehensive assessment of emotional and behavioral problems. This evaluation is designed to understand a patient's mental health. Following this evaluation, the clinician will summarize their evaluation findings and provide treatment recommendations to the family. Recommended treatment may be provided through the OPS or elsewhere. When indicated, OPS clinicians provide evidence-based psychotherapies (e.g., CBT, PCIT as well as individual and group delivery options) and/or psychopharmacology . These services are delivered both in-person as well as virtually pending an agreement with patients/families. OPS clinicians provide collaborative behavioral health care services using consultative and/or co- management care models (e.g., MCPAP) with primary care pediatric and specialty pediatric care providers as well as community behavioral clinicians as indicated. Some problems require long-term care and whenever feasible, once a patient has been stabilized, the OPS clinician works with behavioral health clinicians or primary care practitioners in the community who can assume the care of a patient.","Initial Screening Psychiatry/behavioral health clinicians in the Outpatient Psychiatry Service (OPS), Martha Elliot Health Center (MEHC) and all other BCH ambulatory programs where patients are seen for behavioral health concerns will conduct the CSSRS screen for all patients 10 years and above who are being evaluated or treated for behavioral health conditions as their primary reason for care. . Risk Determination and Intervention • For patients with positive CSSRS screens the clinician will conduct a comprehensive suicide assessment with the CSSRS, determine the level of risk using the SAFE-T protocol, document the level of risk in the EMR and determine the appropriate interventions as described in the Department of Psychiatry SSA protocol. If indicated or at imminent risk, the patient may be sent to the emergency department for further psychiatric evaluation and disposition planning. Reassessments • Suicide screen reassessments of patient being evaluated or treated for behavioral health conditions as their primary reason for care in all ambulatory settings will be guided by the SAFE-T protocol which indicates that reassessments are done at minimum every 6 months and are done more frequently as clinically indicated with any of the following: ◦ Subsequent/Ongoing suicidal behavior ◦ Ongoing/Increased ideation ◦ Pertinent clinical change • Psychiatry/behavioral health clinicians in all BCH ambulatory programs where patients are seen for behavioral health concerns will utilize the CSSRS screen for reassessments and follow the Department of Psychiatry SSA protocol.","Mental health services are addressed in HICS by the Psychosocial Team.

According to the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists (n.d.),: Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS ® ) refers to patient-centered, evidence-based, multidisciplinary team developed pathways for a surgical specialty and facility culture to reduce the patient's surgical stress response, optimize their physiologic function, and facilitate recovery. These care pathways form an integrated continuum, as the patient moves from home through the pre-hospital / preadmission, preoperative, intraoperative, andpostoperative phases of surgery and home again. Depending on the timing of a patient's pre-op visits, the family may not be aware of the ERAS protocol prior to the PCCC visit or SDWU call. Consequently, they will require focused patient-family education during the pre- op visit or phone call.","1.

What are the specific items included in the accurate Interventional Radiology count procedure for sharps guidewires and sponges,0,"Sharp Counts 1. Two individuals, (technologist, physician or nurse) audibly count and view concurrently all sharps and suture needles. 2. The technologist continually maintains an accurate account of all sharps on the sterile field. 3. Members of the IR team account for sharps broken during a procedure in their entirety by matching pieces against an intact same sharp. 4. All counted sharps remain within IR and/or sterile field during the procedure. Do not remove linen or waste containers from IR until all counts are completed and resolved. If a counted sharp is passed off or inadvertently dropped off the sterile field, the IR technologist retrieves it in a safe manner and isolates it from the field to be included in the final count. Keep used needles on the sterile field in a disposable puncture-resistant needle container. 5. Account for and properly dispose of all sharps and miscellaneous items according to OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Standards during end of case cleanup. 6. At the time of permanent relief of the technologist, whenever feasible, (although direct visualization of all items may not be possible). Guidewire Counts Guidewire count should be performed for any procedure where the possibility exists that a guidewire could be retained in the patient. This includes but is not limited to: • Angiograms • Venograms • Sclerotherapy • Endovenous laser procedures • Gastrointestinal tubes • Nephrostomy tubes • Abscess drainages • PICC lines Performing Guidewire Count 1. Two individuals (technologist, physician or nurse) audibly count and view concurrently all used guidewires. Guidewires should be visualized to assure proper integrity and that the distal tip is still intact. This is particularly important if noticeable resistance was encountered during withdrawal of the wire. 2. The technologist continually maintains an accurate account of all guidewire on the sterile field. 3. All counted guidewires remain within IR and/or sterile field during the procedure. Do not remove linen or waste containers from IR until all counts are completed and resolved. If a counted guidewire is inadvertently dropped off the sterile field, the IR technologist retrieves and isolates it from the field to be included in the final count. 4. At the time of permanent relief of the technologist, whenever feasible, (although direct visualization of all items may not be possible). Sponge Count (only for procedures in which surgical pocket is created) 5. All sponges used during an Interventional Radiology procedure in which a ""surgical pocket"" is created, must be x-ray detectable; keep sponges in their original configuration - do not cut. Altering a sponge invalidates subsequent counts and increases the risk of a portion being retained in the pocket. 6. X-ray detectable sponges are counted audibly and viewed concurrently as they are separated and counted by two individuals (technologist, nurse, physician). ◦ Tails of sponges are clearly visible when counting and should not be cut from sponges. ◦ Break all tapes on each sponge pack; separate and count each sponge individually. 7. All counted sponges remain within the IR room/sterile field during the procedure. Do not remove linen or waste containers from the OR room until all counts are completed and resolved. 8. Maintain an ongoing tally of sponges throughout the procedure. 9. Withhold non-radiopaque gauze dressing materials from the field until the surgical pocket is closed and the final count is complete. 10. Account for and properly dispose of all sponges according to OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Standards during end-of case cleanup. 11. Countable sponges should not be cut, however if they need to be cut then all pieces are accounted for in their entirety during the final count. If item has been cut in multiple pieces, compare with an identical, intact item. Measure or trace and compare with original measurement or tracing. Incorrect Counts Procedure If a discrepancy in any count occurs follow these steps: 12. Perform an extensive search of the sterile field, surrounding area, trash and linen for the missing item. 13. When item is not accounted for, the radiologist performs an x-ray or fluoroscopic image to confirm the item is not in the patient. Documentation 14. Mark all unresolved counts as incorrect in Radnet and in the IR physician post procedural documentation stating negative radiological findings. 15. File the required SERS report per state regulations.","• Sharp and guidewire counts are performed for all Interventional Radiology procedures • Sponge counts are done on all Interventional Radiology procedures in which a ""surgical pocket"" is created and the possibility exists that a sponge could be retained. X-ray detectable sponges will be used in all cases that require the creation of a surgical pocket. • Staff involved in the procedure: ◦ Follow standards that are adapted from AORN practices by accounting for all countable items in their entirety. ◦ Maintain a record of counted items added to the sterile field throughout the procedure. ◦ Document in RadNet all counts including the initials of the team members who verify the counts. • Perform guidewire/sharp/sponge item counts: ◦ Before the procedure to establish a baseline. ◦ When additional counted items are added to the sterile field. ◦ At end of the procedure or when surgical pocket is sutured. ◦ At the time of permanent relief of the technologist, whenever feasible, (although direct visualization of all items may not be possible). • If any intraprocedural count is incorrect, follow the hospital's Incorrect Counts Procedure .","Accurate Interventional Radiology count procedure for sharps, guidewires and sponges.","All sharps, guidewires and sponges are accounted for and the results documented.",Counts are performed to account for items and to prevent injury to the patient as a result of a retained foreign object.

What is the process for using a patients medical information including tissue implants or related biological materials for research purposes at Boston Childrens Hospital,0,"• The Primary Provider may determine that certain tissue or related biological materials (such as blood) may need to be tested by a Pathologist to ensure that there are no unexpected problems or new medical conditions that need to be immediately addressed during the procedure. In addition, the provider may need to record the test results to help track the progress of the patient's care following the procedure. • Safety and quality improvement are an important part of everything we do, every day, at Boston Children's hospital. We strive to ensure that all of our clinicians are meeting clinical standards of care set by federal and state regulatory agencies as well as accreditation organizations that BCH is affiliated. This would include conducting an analysis of patient health information to identify strengths and weaknesses in our delivery of care with the goal of developing provider education, improving clinical practices through department specific or enterprise-wide improvement projects, and externally reported quality measures. • The Primary Provider may also use the patient's medical information, including tissue, implants, or related biological materials as well as results from diagnostic testing (for example, radiographs or DNA sequence information), in combination with other patient information in an internal clinical reference database. Residual samples after laboratory testing will be banked for the purpose of building this clinical reference database for further testing. This database may be used by other providers within BCH either (a) for treatment purposes by comparing the patient's results to other relevant cohorts of patients, for example those with the same or similar conditions, or (b) to treat other patients, including those with the same or similar conditions as the patient, by comparing their information to a larger population. In either use, the results may or may not be useful or relevant for the patient's actual or current treatment. • As a world-renowned facility who has developed cures and cutting-edge treatment for children, providers within Boston Children's Hospital may be interested in using tissue, implant, or related biological material as well as a patient's health information for research into causes and cures for existing or future disease. It is BCH policy to first present any proposal to the BCH Institutional Review Board (IRB). The BCH IRB has been established to oversee the protection of human research by reviewing and approving all research that involves human subjects conducted by anyone on the premises of or under the auspices of Boston Children's Hospital. A provider who seeks to use the patient's identified medical information for research must ask the patient and/or their parent/guardian to sign a separate research consent form. Medical information used for research must be de-identified, which means that it cannot have any identifying information about the patient (such as but not limited to, name, age, address, or other descriptive information).","All requests for secondary use human biological specimens /data for research purposes require review by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) administrative office for a determination as to whether the use constitutes non-human subject research or whether it needs to be classified as exempt or require expedited or full committee review. Boston Children's Hospital IRB may review research that involves only the secondary use human biological specimens/data to determine if it: 1. Meets the criteria for human subject research 2. May be considered exempt including the need for limited review when applicable 3. May require review under expedited review procedures or full committee review. 4. If a protocol involves interaction with a subject, a full research protocol is required.","1. A physician from another academic institution is a collaborator on a research protocol at Boston Children's Hospital. He will conduct a specialized clinical test for research purposes and the results will be entered in the medical record of the research subject. In this situation: a. A Reliance Agreement should be established between Boston Children's Hospital and this physician's primary institution. b. The Boston Children's Hospital protocol will be modified through submission of an ""Add Reliance on Boston Children's Hospital"" which will capture information about the Relying institution role in the research and the name of the Relying Institution PI. i. The unaffiliated physician should not be listed as Research Team on the Boston Children's Hospital CHeRP application. c. In accordance with Boston Children's Hospital medical staff bylaws and credentialing requirements, an appointment to the Boston Children's Hospital Medical Staff, House Staff, or Affiliating House Staff is required because clinical information will be charted in the patient medical record. i. if the physician was performing a research assessment at Boston Children's Hospital that would not be documented in the medical record they may not require credentialing but all other steps would need to be completed. d. The PI may also need to work with their department to determine if an Associated Personnel request should be submitted 2. A Boston Children's Hospital investigator wants to have a visiting medical student from a California University recruit patient for a research study. Families will be approached while they are waiting in the emergency room. The investigator also asks that the medical student obtain informed consent. In order to consider permitting this arrangement, the following steps need to be taken: a. A Reliance Agreement with the individual's home institution may be required. b. The Boston Children's Hospital approved protocol will be modified through submission of an ""Add Reliance on Boston Children's Hospital"" which will capture information about the Relying institution's research role and the name of the Relying institution's PI. c. The PI may also need to work with their department to determine if an Associated Personnel request should be submitted d. The Boston Children's Hospital IRB will determine whether the medical student may obtain informed consent on behalf of the investigator. This decision may depend on the patient population as well as the complexity and risks of the research. e. The unaffiliated medical student should not be listed as Research Team on the Boston Children's Hospital CHeRP research protocol. 3. A Boston Children's Hospital investigator is collaborating with an investigator from Brigham Women's Hospital (BWH). All research related procedures and assessments will occur at BWH. Research coordinators from BWH will come to Boston Children's Hospital clinics to recruit Boston Children's Hospital patients for the study. Boston Children's Hospital has agreed to rely on the BWH IRB. In order to allow the BWH coordinators to come on site at Boston Children's Hospital and access records and recruit research subjects, the following steps need to be taken: a. A Reliance Agreement is established between BWH and Boston Children's Hospital. b. The Boston Children's Hospital PI will need to apply for ""Reliance on Another IRB"" through CHeRP. c. The Boston Children's Hospital PI may also need to work with their department to determine if an Associated Personnel request should be submitted to allow for the BWH research coordinators to come on site and access medical records.","The following template language may be used by investigators for various scenarios. Since each protocol is different, it is impossible to provide templates for each possibility. It is the investigator's responsibility to determine which issues apply to their research and to include the appropriate information in the consent document. Investigators should adapt this template language as deemed necessary. 1. Incidental Findings When Scans Images Performed only for Research When imaging subjects there is always the risk of discovering a potential abnormality. We emphasize that the (insert type of image/ scan) being performed for this study are designed to answer specific research questions and they are not designed to be used for any medical diagnoses of conditions that may or may not exist. The research images, as such, are not substitutes for what a doctor would order and so may not show problems that might be picked up by clinically indicated medical images. Your research images will, however, be examined by a trained radiologist or clinician within one week of the exam. If the radiologist/ clinician believes that the research study may show an unexpected abnormality, he/she may request that you return for additional imaging or recommend that you contact your physician for further follow-up. Information generated from the research imaging will become part of your medical record. It is possible that by participating in this research study you could become unnecessarily worried if an abnormality was suspected but later ruled out by further tests. 2. Incidental Findings When More Frequent or Additional Scans/Images Performed only Subjects who are patients at Boston Children's. When imaging subjects there is always the risk of discovering a potential abnormality. We emphasize that the (insert type of image) being performed for this study are designed to answer specific research questions. The research images, as such, are not substitutes for what a doctor would order and so may not show problems that might be picked up by clinically indicated medical/imaging. However, because there are more frequent (or additional) images being performed than would be routinely required for your care, they still will, be examined by a trained radiologist/clinician within one week of the exam. If the radiologist/clinician believes that the research study may show an unexpected abnormality, he/she may request that you return for additional imaging or recommend that you contact your physician for further follow-up. Information generated from the research/imaging will become part of your medical record. It is possible that by participating in this research study you could become unnecessarily worried if an abnormality was suspected but later ruled out by further tests. 3. What will happen with the information obtained as part of this research study? What about confidentiality? In order to perform imaging for this research, you/your child will need to have an appointment scheduled through the hospital systems. If you are already a patient at the hospital your information is already on file. However, if you are not a current Boston Children's Hospital patient, the hospital is required to obtain certain types of information in the event it was ever required for your care. You will be asked for insurance /third party payer information even if the research will cover the costs of these tests. In addition, you will be asked for the name of your primary care provider. You may decide whether or not to provide your primary care providers name. If you do provide this information a report about imaging will be sent to the provider. Medical information collected during this study will become part of your/your child's hospital record. Medical records are considered permanent records. Therefore, materials cannot be deleted from the record. Medical records are available to health care professionals at Boston Children's Hospital and may be reviewed by Hospital staff in the course of carrying out their responsibilities. However, they are required to maintain confidentiality in accordance with applicable laws and Hospital policies. Information contained in your/your child's medical record may not be given to anyone unaffiliated with Boston Children's Hospital in a way that could identify you/your child without written consent, except as required or permitted by law. Information collected during the study that does not become part of your/your child's medical record will be stored in separate research files maintained by the investigator. If you/your child withdraw from the research study, information that has already been collected will become part of the research data. However, you/your child will not be identified.","Touring – The act of physically walking through or viewing a laboratory where chemical, biological and/or radiological materials are present but are not being used.

A • The COVID+ adult should wear an ear loop mask to contain droplets during transport. • If the adult requires supplemental oxygen, use a face mask (as opposed to a nasal cannula) and cover the oxygen mask with an ear loop mask. • Staff assisting with the transport should wear appropriate COVID PPE. • Security officers should clear hallways to prevent others from being within 6 feet of the COVID+ person. R All known COVID+ and PUI can be safely transported to BWH emergency department via the bridge following the appropriate precautions.","1. Change needleless connectors every 96 hours or when clinically indicated: a. When infusing lipid based material or blood/blood products, change needleless connectors every 24 hours. Examples include: Ambisome, Fat Emulsion, Omegaven, Propofol. b. Coordinate needleless connector changes with line changes to limit unnecessary access. 2. Change needleless connectors using aseptic, no-touch technique. 3. Everyone within 6 ft wears a mask. a. Note: Individuals in the other bedspace of a double room with closed curtain do not need a mask.","1. Needleless connectors do not need to be changed after blood sampling unless there is residual blood within the needleless connector. 2. Needleless connectors are changed prior to obtaining a blood or fungal culture . See Blood Culture Policy for details. 3. Scan labs at the point of care or perform a visual double check with a second person (e.g. clinician, parent/guardian, a child that can read and identify him/herself, clinical assistant, administrative associate, child life specialist, etc.). 4. When drawing from a double lumen CVC use the larger lumen when possible: a. Pause all infusions and clamp other lumen(s). b. Careful consideration is advised when evaluating the need to draw labs from a PICC. 5. In the ICUs, consider the use of a closed blood sampling device (e.g., VAMP Jr.™) for patients who require frequent labs as a blood conservation strategy. Additional considerations should include: a. ≥2.6 Fr required if a PICC line is used. b. Use with caution in mobile patients due to the additional weight of the device. c. Preferred dedicated line with a carrier fluid however if access is limited may infuse other fluids except vasoactive infusions. d. Non-ICU use requires a patient-specific decision by the medical team. 6. Return of blood discard (during blood draws) is only done using a closed blood sampling device.","Maintain precautions as indicated in the table below when transporting a patient to other areas. Inform the area receiving the patient in advance regarding the need for precautions. When transporting a patient on precautions within the healthcare facility, the appropriate use of barriers to prevent spread of the infectious agent is based upon the mode of transmission and the patient's circumstances (e.g., age, mental status, etc.). For example, because it may be difficult for an infant to wear a mask, the transporter may need to wear a face mask and make arrangements to avoid other patients, staff and visitors in route (such as using an empty elevator). The patient should not be placed in a waiting room but be taken directly to a single patient room in the department (e.g., exam room) with the door closed.

What actions are taken by the IRB when a research protocol is conditionally approved and how are these actions documented,0,"Voting Actions Approval: When an acceptable risk/benefit ratio exists, and the protocol is approved as submitted. 1. For research to be approved, it requires the approval of the majority of those members present at the meeting. Conditional Approval: When the IRB reviews and approves a research study (or proposed changes to a previously approved research study), the IRB requires as a condition of approval that the investigator: 1. Make specified changes to the research protocol or informed consent document(s), 2. Confirm specific assumptions or understandings on the part of the IRB regarding how the research will be conducted, or 3. Submit additional documents, such that, based on the assumption that the conditions are satisfied, the IRB is able to make all of the determinations required for approval under the federal regulations. When the IRB members determine a protocol is conditionally approved, they also must decide if: 1. the response is sent back to the IRB member primary and secondary reviewers or 2. the IRB analysts (who are also IRB members) to confirm all changes and requests have been made. Deferral: When the changes proposed, or questions raised by the IRB prevent the IRB from making one or more of the determinations and specific changes required for approval by the regulations. Due to: 1. Lack of information or concerns raised in terms of risks and benefits 2. Adequacy of privacy and confidentiality protections 3. Adequacy of the informed consent process Examples of reasons for deferral include: 1. The protocol was poorly written, lacking significant amounts of information regarding scientific justification, procedures, and/or risk reduction. 2. There are significant ethical concerns that do not permit a favorable risk/benefit determination. 3. More information is required or changes in design and procedures must be implemented. 4. There are clarifications and modifications requested directly relevant to determinations required by the regulations such as the data and safety monitoring plan. All responses to deferrals are placed back before the convened IRB for review. Disapproval : When after consultation with the investigator, the IRB determines that the research presents subject risks far outweigh the benefit or value of the knowledge to be gained; or the research raises such serious ethical questions as to be unacceptable. In the event disapproval is foreseen, the investigator is invited to attend the meeting to discuss the protocol. Voting Documentation 1. At the convened IRB meeting, a vote is taken and recorded. 2. The total number of votes is always equal to the total number of members present at the meeting. 3. Minority Reporting: Those members who vote against a majority action on a research protocol is encouraged and is noted within the minutes.","The IRB calculates the date of initial IRB approval in the following manner: 1. Convened IRB Reviewed Study a. When a research study is approved at a convened IRB meeting, the date of the convened IRB meeting is the approval date. b. When the research study is conditionally approved at a convened IRB meeting, the date of the IRB approval remains the date the study was conditionally approved at a convened IRB meeting. The date the designated IRB reviewer determines that the research protocol has satisfied all conditions required, reflected in the CHeRP action ""Research Team Response Adequate"". 2. Expedited Study: When a research study is reviewed and approved through an expedited review process, the date the expedited reviewer approves the research is approval date.","The reporting standards of Boston Children's Hospital PI's are as follows, PIs: 1. Are responsible for promptly reporting to the IRB of record any proposed changes to previously approved human subject protocols. a. These changes are not to be initiated without IRB review and approval, except when required to avoid apparent immediate harm to the subjects. 2. Are responsible for reporting the progress of the approved research to the IRB of record, in the manner and frequency prescribed by the IRB. a. This will depend on whether the research is being followed in accordance with the Revised Common Rule as of 2018 or is following the old Common Rule. 3. Are to promptly report to the IRB of record any unanticipated problems that involve risks to the subjects or others. 4. Are responsible for reporting to the IRB of record all actions or processes that deviate from the protocol procedures approved by the IRB. 5. Are responsible for submitting to the IRB of record copies of all external monitoring reports: Examples, if applicable: a. Data, Safety, and Monitoring Board reports and updates b. Food & Drug Administration annual reviews 6. Are responsible for reporting to the IRB of record any noncompliance with regulations or the institutional policies and procedures under which the research is being conducted.","The nature of Coordinating Center activities may vary from study to study, depending in part on the design of the study and the type of funding mechanism, it is critically important that investigators accurately describe to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) exactly what their responsibilities are. 1. Most Coordinating Center applications receive expedited review, but it is possible that convened IRB review may be needed, depending on the nature of the Coordinating Center responsibilities. 2. It is the expectation of the IRB that those serving as a Coordinating Center will have adequate resources and expertise to carry out these responsibilities and have processes in place to ensure appropriate oversight. The IRB will review the application materials submitted to determine if the operations of the Coordinating Center has sufficient mechanisms in place to ensure that: 1. Management, data analysis, and data safety and monitoring plan (DSMP) systems are adequate, given the nature of the research involved. 2. Sample protocols and informed consent documents are developed and distributed to each collaborating institution. 3. Each collaborating institution holds an applicable Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) approved assurance of compliance with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regulations for the protection of human subjects 4. Each protocol is reviewed and approved by the IRB at the collaborating institution(s) prior to the enrollment of subjects or appropriate reliance agreements are in place. 5. Any substantive modification by the collaborating institution(s) of sample consent information related to risks or alternative procedures is appropriately justified. 6. Informed consent is obtained from each subject in compliance with HHS regulations or that appropriate waivers of alterations are considered and approved when applicable. The IRB will receive from the Coordinating Center PI an IRB protocol submission containing documentation of how the center will ensure that the above activities will be performed appropriately, and a listing of active sites. At the time of initial review, the IRB will assess the procedures for prompt dissemination of protocol information to all participating sites. Assessment of protocol information includes unanticipated problems involving risks to participants, protocol modifications, and interim findings.","Continuing Review Applicability Research approved prior to January 21, 2019 and all FDA regulated research approved before or after 1/21/ 2019. 1. Research approved at a convened IRB meeting or through expedited review prior to January 21, 2019 and all FDA regulated research will undergo continuing review. 2. Protocols originally approved at a convened IRB meeting may undergo expedited continuing review: a. When: i. The research is permanently closed to the enrollment of new subjects and ii. All the subjects have completed all research-related interventions; and iii. The research remains active only for long term follow-up of subjects; or b. Where no subjects have been enrolled and no additional risks have been identified; or c. Where remaining research activities are limited to data analysis 3. Continuing review may be conducted through expedited procedures, if: a. It is non-FDA regulated research, (not conducted under investigational new drug application or investigational device exemption), and b. Where the permitted expedited categories do not apply, but the IRB has determined and documented at a convened meeting that the research i. Involves no greater than minimal risk a nd ii. No additional risks have been identified. 4. Review will be conducted at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less than once per year. Time Interval Upon initial review of a protocol, the IRB determines the time interval for the next continuing review. Review must occur within 1-year of the last approval date for a protocol to remain active; however, the IRB may decide more frequent review is necessary. 1. Convened IRB : For a protocol reviewed by the convened IRB, continuing review must occur within 1 year of the protocol being approved at a convened IRB meeting. 2. Expedited Review : For a protocol approved under expedited review that still requires Continuing Review, the review must occur within 1 year of the date the IRB Chair or designated IRB member(s) provide initial approval. More Frequent Review More frequent review may be based on a specific time interval or on a requirement to report back after a specified number of participants have been studied. In making the determination that more frequent review is required, the IRB takes into consideration: 1. The risk of the protocol and 2. The type of information the IRB would like to receive in order to assure appropriate oversight on an ongoing basis. Criteria used to consider whether more frequent review is required includes the following : 1. High-risk protocols where there is concern about significant adverse events that may be permanent, irreversible, or disabling, or that may significantly compromise the research subject. 2. Protocols where the potential risks are completely unknown, unless the minutes document that approval is granted for 1 year. 3. Protocols that involve newborns that include conditions for which it is not possible to perform studies in older children. 4. Protocols submitted with data from preliminary studies that raise concern regarding the possibility of serious adverse events. If more frequent review is required, the investigator will be informed through the approval notification and the CHeRP system will be set to notify the investigator at the required time. At the time of continuing review, the convened IRB or expedited reviewer will assure that all criteria for approval of research continue to be met. Review Tracking The IRB administrative office is responsible for tracking continuing reviews and for notifying investigators when review is required. The Continuing Review SmartForm must be submitted and approved prior to the protocol's expiration date. Principal Investigators (PIs) must submit the continuing review with ample time for the IRB to address any needed questions and revisions. 1. Three months before the protocol's expiration, the CHeRP system will send an automated notice to the PI and research team. 2. If the continuing review is not received, then a. A second notice will be sent at 2 months before the expiration date. b. A third notice will be sent 1 month before the expiration date. Continuing Review: Expedited and Convened IRB Review Process Expedited Review Continuing reviews which qualify for expedited review may be reviewed through the expedited review procedures. Convened IRB All continuing reviews which do not qualify for expedited review are placed on the agenda for the convened IRB meeting. The IRB will use the same criteria and take the same actions described in the IRB policy, 1. One IRB reviewer is assigned to each continuing review. 2. No member with a conflict of interest may serve as a reviewer. 3. All members can access the continuing review submission via CHeRP. Through CHeRP, IRB members have electronic access to the complete IRB protocol file and relevant IRB minutes, including amendments/modifications, unanticipated problems, and previous continuing review approvals. 4. The Continuing Review SmartForm includes: a. The number of subjects accrued: i. Enrolled (signed consent form) ii. Withdrawn due to subject request iii. Withdrawn due to toxicity/adverse events iv. Lost to follow-up v. Completed study (without events leading to early termination) vi. Currently active on study vii. Other category b. Removed for ineligibility c. A summary of adverse events and any unanticipated problems that involve risks to subjects or others, and any withdrawal of subjects from the research or complaints about the research since the last IRB review. d. If applicable: i. A summary of any relevant recent literature and interim findings. ii. Data and safety monitoring reports may be submitted. iii. Any relevant multi-center trial reports. iv. Monitoring reports from sponsors. e. Any other relevant information, particularly information about risks associated with the research. f. Links to the currently approved protocol, recruitment documents, and informed consent documents. g. Information regarding reliance arrangements 5. IRB members are provided with a continuing review Reviewer Worksheet to complete. When reviewing the current informed consent document, the IRB ensures that : a. The currently approved or proposed consent document is still accurate and complete; and b. Any significant new findings that may relate to the subject's willingness to continue to participate are provided to the subject. 6. The IRB may request and rely on a current statement from the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) or the sponsor that indicates it has reviewed study-wide adverse events, interim findings, and any recent literature that may be relevant to the research, in lieu of requiring that this information be submitted directly to the IRB. 7. In general, when taking an action of conditional approval at the time of continuing review, any noted conditions need to be satisfied before an investigator may continue research activities related to the conditions specified. a. During the continuing review, the IRB may make determinations that currently enrolled subjects may continue, but no new subjects may be enrolled until a designated IRB member reviews a revised protocol and verifies that conditions are met. 8. After the convened IRB meeting, the investigator is sent notification of the action taken. a. When approved, the informed consent dates are modified to reflect the new period of approval and expiration.",3,1,0,3,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1

Note: A Graded Challenge (test dose) is different than medication desensitization. A graded challenge is a procedure to determine if a drug is safe to administer. It is intended for patients who are unlikely to be allergic to the given drug. In contrast to desensitization, a graded challenge does not modify the immune response to a drug. The medication desensitization procedure is designed to allow safe delivery of a medication to a patient who has been deemed allergic to that medication.","1. Boston Children's Hospital (BCH), as an American College of Surgeons verified Level I Pediatric Trauma Center, is expected to accept trauma patients at all times. 2. During peak volume conditions BCH implements responses to coordinate resources: 3. Surge Protocol – implemented during volume surges indicated by excessive emergency room wait times or selective new patient acceptance. 4. Code Help – An adjunct to the Surge Protocol that is designed to manage the sudden influx of critically ill or injured patients 5. Code Triage – Activation based on an external emergency event which has the potential of generating a large influx of patients 6. BCH may experience situations when it may be necessary to enter into a treat and transfer mode; the Emergency Department will not divert ambulances during these times. Such transfers follow all applicable laws (EMTALA) and regulations. Note: If an emergency incident creates hazardous conditions that prevent safe patient arrival to the Hospital, BCH may declare a Code Black and may temporarily divert ambulances.","The following questions and answers are intended to help researchers and the IRB determine when immediate safety plans are required. 1. What type of questionnaires or assessments would require an immediate safety action plan? An immediate safety plan is required for questionnaires or assessments that either: a. Include individual items that indicate that someone is at real potential risk for harm – this would include single items that ask about suicidality, or child abuse, or plans to commit a violent act, etc. or b. Use tools that validly correspond to specific psychological conditions and have established ""clinically- actionable"" values or scores that suggest a potential diagnosis (e.g., Beck Depression Inventory) Participants who score in the clinical range on validated assessments or provide a concerning answer on individual items should trigger the safety action plan. 2. Do quality of life assessments or questionnaires that may ask about sadness, feeling anxiousness, or levels of stress require a safety action plan? These assessments are not typically developed to identify potential mental/psychological illnesses or actionable conditions such as depression and mood disorders. These scales do not require an immediate safety plan. a. However, when possible, investigators should consider ways of maximizing the potential for benefit for subjects who agree to participate in research. b. Depending on the type of information learned and the relationship with the subject, there may be ways to utilize the information from these questionnaires for the benefit of the subject. i. For example, responses may suggest that it may be helpful to offer a subject a referral to a social worker or provide additional resource information. c. Investigators also need to consider whether it may be beneficial to include results of validated assessments in the medical record so that other care providers may have access to the information and the ability to use the information for comparisons over time or if thought to be clinically relevant for planning care. i. These plans should be described in the potential benefit section of the research protocol and included in the informed consent document or process. 3. What should an immediate safety plan include? The following components must be included in a safety plan and specified in the protocol submitted to the IRB. In general, safety plans should align with standard clinical practice. If a safety plan deviates from standard practice, a rationale for the deviation should be provided. The IRB also expects that, when necessary, those who develop safety plans seek guidance from individuals experienced with standard clinical practice. This will help assure the plan meets the standards required. Items to note: a. The assessments should be reviewed immediately when a subject is present or within 24 hours if the information is collected remotely. b. The individual performing/collecting and reviewing the assessments must be qualified to interpret the results or have plans to consult with qualified individuals within a specified time frame. Protocols should include these plans based on the acuity of the response. c. Plans need to include immediate referral to appropriate mental health personnel and services for further assessment and management d. Plans must also include appropriate notification of the concern to the subject and parents/legal guardians (if applicable). e. Plans should include notification of relevant agencies (i.e., Dept. of Children and Families) or use of law enforcement personnel (e.g., police, security, etc.) to detain the individual for assessment and necessary services (if applicable). f. The consent form should include information so that subjects/recognize the potential need to breach confidentiality and obtain necessary services.

What is the main focus of the Care of Patients After Termination of Pregnancy document,0,• This document identifies the perioperative considerations for patients that have (or will have) undergone termination of a pregnancy.,"If a patient has recently terminated a pregnancy, it is important to verify termination prior to moving forward with a planned procedure.","• Per BCH Anesthesia Clinical Guidelines & Policies: ◦ In general, patients who have recently had a termination of pregnancy within 6 weeks before surgery should not be scheduled for elective surgery. Reasons for this include a persistent elevation in ßHCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) levels for up to 4 weeks after a termination and for resolution of the maternal physiologic changes of pregnancy to the pre-pregnancy state. ◦ For all patients who have had a recent termination of a pregnancy (greater than 6 weeks and within 3 months of a scheduled surgical procedure), a written note (for a surgical termination) must be obtained from the clinician who performed the termination. This note should document any complications (infection, bleeding) from the termination and verify that the termination was complete. ◦ In addition, for patients who have had a medical termination of pregnancy with mifepristone/ misoprostol, the clinician responsible for the termination must document that the termination was complete with either with a follow up ultrasound or ßHCG level. ◦ All female patients (12 years of age and older or any patient who has started menstruation) must have a ßHCG (either urine or serum) obtained before undergoing a surgical procedure. • Additional Considerations: ◦ It is considered ""best care"" for a patient to follow up with the Gynecologist who performed the termination to verify termination ◦ If a patient cannot follow up with their clinician prior to surgery, a ßHCG level can be used to verify termination ▪ If ßHCG >5 mIU/mL (i.e. positive), the case will need to be cancelled and the patient will need an evaluation by the Gynecologist who performed the termination ◦ Regardless of the method of termination (surgical vs. medical), ßHCG levels are an acceptable way to verify pregnancy termination","The model of care used is the Synergy Model (Professional Model of Care). This model of care matches individual nurse competencies and the patient needs when assigning patients. On the unit the primary focus is providing continuity of care within a family-centered approach. Patients with lengths of stay over 48 hours are assigned a nurse who is responsible for overall coordination of care and discharge planning throughout the patient's stay. The nurse communicates with a team of nurses who provide continuity of care. Patients with shorter lengths of stay have their care coordinated on a shift basis by an appropriately experienced RN. Nursing care is consistent with the Massachusetts Nurse Practice Act, ANA standards, and the standards and policies and procedures of the Department of Nursing. Unit and hospital wide guidelines and protocols for the management of patients are used, evaluated and updated when appropriate. Age-specific care guidelines are used.","Complete patient care documentation as described in the Patient Care Manual.

How can the information in the document Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ERASpdf be utilized to improve patient care in the hospital,0,"Many surgeons now utilize service-specific ERAS protocols. According to the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists (n.d.),: Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS ® ) refers to patient-centered, evidence-based, multidisciplinary team developed pathways for a surgical specialty and facility culture to reduce the patient's surgical stress response, optimize their physiologic function, and facilitate recovery. These care pathways form an integrated continuum, as the patient moves from home through the pre-hospital / preadmission, preoperative, intraoperative, andpostoperative phases of surgery and home again. Depending on the timing of a patient's pre-op visits, the family may not be aware of the ERAS protocol prior to the PCCC visit or SDWU call. Consequently, they will require focused patient-family education during the pre- op visit or phone call.","• ERAS protocols exist for the following procedures: ◦ ACL IT Band ◦ Abdominal Surgery ◦ Bladder Exstrophy ◦ PAO ◦ Orthognathic Procedures with OMFS Team ◦ Gender Affirming Chest Reconstructive Surgery ◦ Reduction Mammoplasty (not for Dr. Ganke's patients as of 9/19/22) • ERAS should be noted on the OR booking sheet ◦ If ERAS is NOT noted on the OR booking sheet, contact the surgeon and/or associated PA/NP to confirm if the patient will be on the ERAS protocol • To access a surgical service's ERAS protocol, follow the steps below: ◦ BCH Homepage > Departments & Programs > Anesthesiology, Critical Care and Pain Medicine > Clinical Guidelines & Policies > Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) • During care coordination, RN/NP staff should: ◦ Note ""ERAS"" in the following sections of the PAEF: ▪ Special Needs ▪ Anesthesia Pre-Op Discussion ▪ Nursing Communication ◦ Print a copy of the appropriate service-specific ERAS protocol and place it in the patient's paper chart for review at the pre-op visit • During the pre-op visit/phone call, the RN/NP should: ◦ Review the pre-op portion of the ERAS protocol ◦ Refer the family to the surgeon and/or anesthesiologist for additional questions related to ERAS","The Cardiac Operating Room participates in collection of data related to program and hospital focus that may include the following examples: • Hospital wide audits • Core Metrics • Patient and family satisfaction via Press Ganey • National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators (NDNQI) • National Patient Safety Goals • Unit based monthly audits • Healthy Work Environment Assessment annually • Quality Assurance Process Improvement (QAPI) strategies and projects including but limited to: ◦ Blood Product Utilization and Conservation ◦ Quarterly multidisciplinary CVOR Perfusion Update meeting presented by the perfusion team ◦ Procedural outcomes are closely monitored and tracked by the divisions of cardiac surgery ◦ NCDR (National Cardiovascular Data Registry) ▪ IMPACT (Improving Pediatric and Adult Congenital Treatments) ◦ Society for Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Congenital Heart Surgery Database ◦ C3QMP ◦ Operation specific outcomes and analysis hospital based and worldwide such as Ozaki Procedure Registry ◦ Enhanced Recovery After Cardiac Surgery (ERAS Cardiac) ◦ Neonatal consortium, multidisciplinary team, meets monthly and three times per week rounds on all Neonates in CICU All nursing staff participates in Quality Assurance Process Improvement (QAPI) activities through chart reviews, data collection, data analysis, and discussion of indicators and improvement strategies.

Convened IRB presentation: The primary and secondary reviewers present the protocol to the IRB at a convened meeting. a. The primary reviewer presents a brief summary of the protocol, followed by their comments. b. The secondary reviewer presents their comments only. c. Following presentation by the primary and secondary reviewer, the IRB is invited to provide additional comments. i. All members are asked to review all protocols and informed consents in preparation for the discussion. 3. Primary and secondary reviewers receive a Reviewer Worksheet that must be completed and uploaded in IRB electronic system prior to IRB meeting. a. The use of this worksheet is mandatory. b. The worksheet guides the reviewer comments and is structured to discuss the issues within the context of the regulatory criteria. c. The worksheet requires that reviewers consider all the regulatory criteria required for approval.","1. IRB members are assigned to serve as either primary or secondary reviewers for new protocols, continuing reviews, amendments/revisions, unanticipated problems, and other administrative and ethical issues pertinent to human subject protections. 2. All members are expected to read all protocols and submissions before a meeting and to participate in meeting discussions. 3. The IRB administrative staff assign reviewers based on the member's knowledge and expertise. The IRB administrative staff are responsible for ensuring that at least one member attending the meeting has the necessary knowledge and expertise to review the protocol. 4. When the agenda includes protocols that involve vulnerable populations, the IRB administrative staff is responsible for ensuring that at least one member attending the meeting has knowledge and experience in working with the study population. a. Example: For research sponsored by the Department of Education and/or funded by the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research that purposefully require inclusion of children with disabilities and/or individuals with mental disabilities as research subjects, the IRB will include at least one person who is knowledgeable about and experienced in working with these categories of participants. 5. Boston Children's Hospital reserves the right to reschedule protocols for review based on the experience and expertise of the members attending the IRB meeting and to seek expert consultation if deemed necessary. 6. If an IRB member is unable to attend a meeting, they are to contact the IRB office as soon as possible, to ensure that an alternate member be assigned. If it is determined that a member cannot attend after the protocols are distributed, there are two possible options: a. The member who cannot attend may review the protocol and submit written comments. However, this will not be included in a quorum. b. The IRB member may contact the IRB office and another IRB member will be assigned the review.","The nature of Coordinating Center activities may vary from study to study, depending in part on the design of the study and the type of funding mechanism, it is critically important that investigators accurately describe to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) exactly what their responsibilities are. 1. Most Coordinating Center applications receive expedited review, but it is possible that convened IRB review may be needed, depending on the nature of the Coordinating Center responsibilities. 2. It is the expectation of the IRB that those serving as a Coordinating Center will have adequate resources and expertise to carry out these responsibilities and have processes in place to ensure appropriate oversight. The IRB will review the application materials submitted to determine if the operations of the Coordinating Center has sufficient mechanisms in place to ensure that: 1. Management, data analysis, and data safety and monitoring plan (DSMP) systems are adequate, given the nature of the research involved. 2. Sample protocols and informed consent documents are developed and distributed to each collaborating institution. 3. Each collaborating institution holds an applicable Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) approved assurance of compliance with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regulations for the protection of human subjects 4. Each protocol is reviewed and approved by the IRB at the collaborating institution(s) prior to the enrollment of subjects or appropriate reliance agreements are in place. 5. Any substantive modification by the collaborating institution(s) of sample consent information related to risks or alternative procedures is appropriately justified. 6. Informed consent is obtained from each subject in compliance with HHS regulations or that appropriate waivers of alterations are considered and approved when applicable. The IRB will receive from the Coordinating Center PI an IRB protocol submission containing documentation of how the center will ensure that the above activities will be performed appropriately, and a listing of active sites. At the time of initial review, the IRB will assess the procedures for prompt dissemination of protocol information to all participating sites. Assessment of protocol information includes unanticipated problems involving risks to participants, protocol modifications, and interim findings.","IRB administrators initially determine whether the protocol meets the criteria for expedited review as specified by the regulations, which include the applicability criteria. 1. It is important to recognize that procedures that may be considered minimal risk in adults may not be minimal risk in children. This may be the result of psychological or emotional distress, even if the actual procedures present minimal physical risk to the subject. 2. The standard requirements for informed consent (or its waiver, alteration, or exception) apply. IRB Chair/Vice Chair Review After initial screening by the IRB administrative staff and the pre-review, the protocols are brought to the attention of the IRB Chair or Vice Chairs. The Chair or Vice Chairs will: 1. Review the protocol. 2. Any IRB member may be asked to serve as an expedited reviewer as required, based on their experience and length of service. 3. Designate an experienced IRB member to provide review. a. IRB Chairs may designate themselves to perform the review. b. The IRB Chair/Vice Chair will consider: i. The discipline of the research protocol and expertise of members ii. Length of the IRB member's service c. IRB members are asked to declare conflict of interest (COI) for any protocol they are asked to review through expedited review procedures. i. No member with a COI may serve as a reviewer for any expedited item. ii. If there is a COI, the protocol will be reassigned. d. If a protocol involves prisoners and is eligible for expedited review, the prisoner representative will be one of the designated expedited reviewers. e. The IRB Chair/Vice Chairs may also refer any protocol to the full committee for review at a convened meeting. i. Even when expedited review is allowed in accordance with federal regulations, the Chair/Vice Chairs reserve the right to request full committee review. ii. The Chair's/Vice Chair's determination is final. 4. The IRB member who conducts the expedited review will be given access to the electronic submission which includes the following: a. Protocol SmartForms b. Experimental design c. Consent/assent Forms d. Consent/assent Waiver and Alteration Information e. Financial disclosure and any management plan provided by compliance review f. Information about Informational Technologies (IT) , privacy, and security provisions g. Recruitment materials: notices, postings, letters h.

Investigational Device Data k. Request for clinical imaging equipment for research l. Radiation exposure and radioactive materials m. Supplemental genetic information n. Pregnant women and fetuses information o. Prisoners In addition to the above items, reviewers will have access to the following: p. Investigational drug/device brochures or other information provided by the sponsor q. Assessments, and questionnaires that are not standard r. Additional reference information s. Copies of the scientific reviewers' forms and any correspondence related to the departmental scientific review or other ancillary reviews 5. All the criteria specified in 45 CFR 46 are applied as part of the expedited review process. a. In reviewing the research, the IRB reviewers may exercise all the authorities of the IRB except that the reviewers may not disapprove the research. b. The designated IRB reviewer may at any time determine that the protocol be forwarded to the full IRB committee for review. 6. Reviewer and investigator correspondence: Any questions, comments, or requests for revisions (i.e. any informed consent document concerns) that are received from the reviewer are sent to the investigator through the CHeRP system. The expedited reviewer will indicate whether they want to receive: a. the investigator's response or b. the IRB administrative staff can verify that the changes have been made. The investigator must respond through the CHeRP system, and submit any revised forms, protocols and informed consent documents. a. If an investigator is not willing to accept the recommendations and requirements presented as part of the expedited review process, then the protocol and the correspondence to date will be placed on the convened IRB agenda for the next scheduled meeting. b. If all issues are resolved and the informed consent finalized, approval will be given. 7. The expedited reviewer is required to complete a Reviewer Worksheet which contains all the regulatory criteria for approval and include it in the CHeRP system. 8. The date the expedited reviewer signs off for final approval of the study is the date the approval period starts. 9. If applicable, the primary expedited reviewer must document rationale for requiring an annual continuing review. Otherwise, the protocol requires an annual administrative update. 10. Research activity may be disapproved only after review in accordance with the non-expedited procedures. A list including the protocol titles, PIs, protocol numbers, and designated expedited review categories is sent to the full committee at its next scheduled meeting.","Voting Actions Approval: When an acceptable risk/benefit ratio exists, and the protocol is approved as submitted. 1. For research to be approved, it requires the approval of the majority of those members present at the meeting. Conditional Approval: When the IRB reviews and approves a research study (or proposed changes to a previously approved research study), the IRB requires as a condition of approval that the investigator: 1. Make specified changes to the research protocol or informed consent document(s), 2. Confirm specific assumptions or understandings on the part of the IRB regarding how the research will be conducted, or 3. Submit additional documents, such that, based on the assumption that the conditions are satisfied, the IRB is able to make all of the determinations required for approval under the federal regulations. When the IRB members determine a protocol is conditionally approved, they also must decide if: 1. the response is sent back to the IRB member primary and secondary reviewers or 2. the IRB analysts (who are also IRB members) to confirm all changes and requests have been made. Deferral: When the changes proposed, or questions raised by the IRB prevent the IRB from making one or more of the determinations and specific changes required for approval by the regulations. Due to: 1. Lack of information or concerns raised in terms of risks and benefits 2. Adequacy of privacy and confidentiality protections 3. Adequacy of the informed consent process Examples of reasons for deferral include: 1. The protocol was poorly written, lacking significant amounts of information regarding scientific justification, procedures, and/or risk reduction. 2. There are significant ethical concerns that do not permit a favorable risk/benefit determination. 3. More information is required or changes in design and procedures must be implemented. 4. There are clarifications and modifications requested directly relevant to determinations required by the regulations such as the data and safety monitoring plan. All responses to deferrals are placed back before the convened IRB for review. Disapproval : When after consultation with the investigator, the IRB determines that the research presents subject risks far outweigh the benefit or value of the knowledge to be gained; or the research raises such serious ethical questions as to be unacceptable. In the event disapproval is foreseen, the investigator is invited to attend the meeting to discuss the protocol. Voting Documentation 1. At the convened IRB meeting, a vote is taken and recorded. 2. The total number of votes is always equal to the total number of members present at the meeting. 3. Minority Reporting: Those members who vote against a majority action on a research protocol is encouraged and is noted within the minutes.",4,4,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
In what instances should humidified supplemental oxygen therapy be administered to patients in the PACU,1,"1. Before admission to the PACU, the OR notifies the PACU of the estimated patient arrival time and: a. Need for isolation, precautions (respiratory, immunosuppression, latex/allergy) b. Need for special equipment (oral airway, A-line, chest tube, intubated, trach, NG tube) c. Special needs (developmental delay, physical limitations, psychosocial concerns) 2. The PACU nurse ensures the patient care area is prepared to provide equipment for the care of the patient including: a. Mapleson bag with appropriately sized face mask b. Suction c. Oxygen saturation monitor d. Blood pressure monitoring equipment e. Means of achieving privacy f. Oxygen delivery devices i. Some instances require humidified supplemental oxygen therapy. ii. This consists of, but is not limited to patients who have undergone laryngoscopies, bronchoscopies, esophagoscopies, laser excisions of laryngeal or tracheal papilomas and tonsillectomies. iii. In addition, administer humidified oxygen therapy to any patient with upper airway compromise, specifically stridor or a history of croup.","Deliver oxygen supplementation according to standardized methods for hypoxia. The degree of hypoxia for which supplemental oxygen should be given is guided by other clinical severity assessment measures in most instances. For example, patients who are otherwise not in distress, oxygen should be administered as needed to maintain oxygen saturation > 90%. For patients who are in distress (tachypneic, febrile, short of breath) or who have HASS scores > 9, oxygen should be administered to maintain oxygen saturation > 95%.",• A prescriber order is required for the administration of supplemental oxygen except in emergency situations. • Supplemental oxygen at the highest possible concentration and with the most readily available device should be administered in emergency situations. • Purpose ◦ To ensure safe and optimal administration of supplemental oxygen.,"There are the broad uses for compressed air in clinical areas: • Air is used with oxygen as a dual gas source to operate ventilators in the ICUs and anesthesia machines in the operating room. Certain ventilators and BIPAP machines can operate without a high pressure air source. Other ventilators can operate without air but will default to a FiO2 of 100% in the absence of air. • Air is mixed with oxygen via a blender to deliver oxygen concentrations between 21 and 100 percent to supply high flow nasal cannula systems, continuous nebulizers and ECMO membranes. • Air is used as a vehicle to provide humidity to patients who do not have a supplemental oxygen requirement. Humidified air can be delivered via a facemask or trach collar. During a medical air disruption, these devices can be run off of an oxygen flowmeter on the headwall. Adjust the FiO2 setting on the humidification device to obtain the desired oxygen concentration. • Providing humidified air will be a low priority during a disruption in the air system.","• Convert patients receiving supplemental oxygen to portable oxygen cylinders • In an oxygen failure, assess all patients on heliox therapy for adequate FiO2 delivery. • Identify the number of patients requiring oxygen and air support. Notify the Hospital Command Center at ext 5-2900. • Assure the delivery of additional portable oxygen tanks as needs are determined. • If a longer term oxygen loss event, portable oxygen flow may be titrated in to ventilator circuits to maintain an acceptable Fio2 • Determine if evacuation is indicated based on incident evaluation. • Identify location of unit based oxygen tank bank. There are emergency banks of oxygen cylinders and self-inflating bags in each of the ICUS.

What are the common risk factors for acquiring CarbapenemResistant Enterobacteriaceae CRE in the hospital setting,1,"Enterobacteriaceae are a family of gram negative bacteria found in soil, water, vegetation, decaying matter, and the large intestines of humans and animals. Examples include Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli . These are a normal part of the human gut bacteria but can become resistant to carbapenem antibiotics. CRE is more common in the hospital setting than the general community. Patients with ventilators, urinary catheters, and IV catheters as well as those on long-term antibiotics are most susceptible. Transmission is via direct or indirect contact with infected individuals as well as contaminated water or food. Some CRE bacteria have become resistant to most available antibiotics, making infections difficult if not impossible to treat. CRE are associated with high mortality rates (up to 50%) and are a serious threat to public health.","• Contact Precautions are needed for all inpatient admissions, ED visits, and high-risk ambulatory settings that perform invasive procedures • Confirm the patient has multidrug resistant organism (MDRO) Contact Precautions listed in the banner bar • Standard Precautions are to be followed for patients who are known to be colonized with a MDRO coming through the PCCC ◦ Ensure gown and glove use for contact with pressure ulcers, draining wounds, uncontrolled secretions, stool incontinence, and ostomy bags ◦ Note contact precautions in the PAEF ""Special Needs"" list • Refer to Infection Prevention Control Manual Entry for Management of Patients with MDRO as noted below in ""Related Content"" for further details","Outpatient: the setting in which a patient who undergoes medical studies and/or treatment without being admitted to a hospital.

Preoperative antibiotics Appropriate antibiotics to cover common organisms are needed. One study has suggested that use of clindamycin increases risk of infection. There are several studies as discussed above that have demonstrated a high rate of gram negative infections, and therefore coverage for these organisms makes sense. In addition, appropriate timing of antibiotic dosing is critical, as inappropriate dosing as defined as antibiotics given greater than 60 minutes prior to incision represent a risk of infection. The current recommendations of the AAOS are to use appropriate antibiotics for 24 hours postoperatively. One study failed to demonstrate a benefit of continuing antibiotics beyond 24 hours when a drain is in place. References 24.

Personnel other than the ECMO specialist do not manipulate the circuit or components without prior agreement and performance of a time out with the ECMO specialist. 4. ECMO care follows guidelines and policies set forth by the Cardiac ECMO program at Children's Hospital Boston. 5. Tailor management of ECMO to the needs of the patients with daily goals established by the Critical Care and Surgical team caring for the patient. 6. ECMO initiated to support cardiopulmonary resuscitation (E-CPR) is best initiated in the CICU and the Cath Lab, and must be requested by the CICU and Cardiac Surgical Attending. In other areas it is preferable to transfer patients to CICU while receiving effective CPR for ECMO cannulation rather than attempting to bring all resources for cannulation to an outlying area.","Elective ECMO 1. An ECMO Specialist prepares and maintains ECMO circuits. 2. Circuit preparation consists of a step-wise priming procedure, with the final step being the addition of blood products. Once blood products are added and treated, the crystalloid solution is displaced, and an ECMO circuit panel is measured. 3. The lab results are designated as a ""Circuit Panel"", indicating the results are from the circuit prior to patient interaction. Circuit Panel Targets pH 7.35 - 7.45 PCO 35-45 mmHg 2 PO > 300 mmHg 2 HCO - 22-24 mEq/L 3 K + < 8 mEq/L Circuit Panel Targets Ionized Ca ++ > 0.8 mEq/L Na + > 125 mEq/L ECPR 1. Two readily deployable circuits are available for ECPR; a neonatal circuit for patients < 8 kg, and a pediatric circuit for patients >8 kg. The circuits are rapidly primed with PlasmaLyte-A, albumin, and heparin. Cannulae Selection Cannulae selection is determined by: • Route: Groin, neck, or chest • Surgical Technique: Cut-down or percutaneous • Type of ECMO support: VV, VVDL, VVV, VVA, or VA • Refer to ECMO Reference Tools . Pre-cannulation Considerations 1. The ICU Attending Physician, Fellow, or Nursing confirms: ◦ Clot present in blood bank ◦ Neurologic assessment (HUS for neonates) ◦ Venous and arterial access ◦ Plan for sedation and analgesia ◦ Review of outside ECHO (if available). 2. Nursing obtains: ◦ CBC ◦ Clot ◦ PT, PTT, Fibrinogen ◦ Electrolytes 3. Position patient for cannulation; infants are best positioned with head at the foot of the bed for neck cannulations. 4. Prepare medications: ◦ Routine resuscitation medications ◦ Heparin bolus of 75 units/kg ◦ Heparin 100 units/mL in D10W or D5W (total 50mL) for continuous infusion ◦ Hydralazine 0.1 mg/kg/dose IV ◦ 5% albumin ◦ Normal saline for fluid resuscitation ◦ Amicar if indicated ◦ Sedation and analgesia as ordered by the ICU Fellow or Nurse Practitioner ◦ Paralytic agent as ordered by the ICU Fellow or Nurse Practitioner Cannulation 1. A surgical team performs the cannulation procedure, and conducts a procedure ""time-out"" prior to incision. Refer to ECMO Time Out . 2. The ICU Team monitors and manages hemodynamics, airway, ventilatory support, and ensures sedation and analgesia during the cannulation procedure. 3. At the direction and discretion of the cannulating surgeon, the patient may receive a bolus of 75 units/kg of heparin prior to placement of cannulae. 4. Once cannulae have been secured, the ECMO circuit drainage and re-infusion lines are passed to the surgeon in a sterile manner and cut away from the ECMO priming reservoir. 5. The drainage, or venous line, is indicated with a blue marker and the re-infusion, or arterial line, with a red marker. Once a second time out is performed, and the surgeon verifies air-free connections, and the ECMO Specialist verifies that the lines are connected properly, the line clamps are removed and the ECMO pump is started.","1. ECMO Specialist is notified (pager 3266) of a potential need for Mobile ECMO and confirms receiving the notification with the Communication Center (52170). 2. ECMO Specialist verifies that the Communication Center has been notified if a request for Mobile ECMO is made through other channels. 3. ECMO Specialist obtains preliminary information from the Communication Center, including age, weight, and reason for support (cardiac or non-cardiac). 4. ECMO Specialist notifies RC Supervisor (pager 1055) of potential need for Mobile ECMO, and discusses resources and staffing logistics to deploy two ECMO Specialists for the transport. 5. Once the patient has been accepted there will be a conference call with the ECMO Specialist, CCTT Crew Chief, and the Medical control physician (ICU Attending) to determine if the mission can be performed. The ECMO Specialist should be prepared to describe staffing plan. 6. ECMO Specialist will complete intake with the Communication Center using Intake Form, and may also request a conference call with BCH Team and referring perfusionist if further technical information is needed.",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

If the radiologist indicates that the films are of a high profile nature, then they should be removed to the Manager, Support Services' office and signed out to ""MACDL""","HEPA filters are repaired or replaced, as needed, when inspected during recertification. Hospital Engineering changes pre-filters on horizontal laminar flow hoods monthly and places a sticker on the hood indicating the date of the change.","Outside Images that are not requested to become part of the patient's medical record When outside images are returned to the Radiology Image Service Center, they are to be mailed back to the appropriate hospital. If outside images are received by the Image Service Area, the proper destination for these films should be determined and brought or sent there. If the images are to be delivered to another location within the hospital, the location should be noted on the envelope and sent through interoffice mail. If the film is simply addressed ""Children's Hospital,"" a check will be made to see if the patient is an inpatient, in which case the films will be put in the inpatient file. If the images are to go to a radiologist, the film should be left for the supervisor to follow up the following day. Most other outside images are to be returned immediately to the proper hospital. The only exception to this is when incoming images are unaddressed. In this case, the images are placed in appropriate slot in the back area of the Image Service Center and kept for one month.

The MWT should be conducted when a patient is clinically stable and when treatments of any known sleep disorders are well established and effective. 3. Prior to the MWT, the sleep clinician should determine the patient's use of tobacco, caffeine and medications. Drug screening may be indicated to ensure that sleepiness or wakefulness during the MWT is not influenced by substances other than medically prescribed drugs. The physician may request a urine specimen for drug screening; the physician determines the timing of specimen collection. 4. The sleep clinician should develop a plan regarding the use of prescription medications, OTC agents, herbal remedies, and other substances. If the patient is chronically taking medications with alerting or sedating properties, then they should be continued at a stable dose. Changes in medications should be avoided for 2 weeks before testing. The patient should be instructed to consult with the clinician before starting a prescription or OTC medication before the test. 5. Relevant clinical data such as preceding sleep schedules, PAP adherence, or other therapies should be available to the interpreting clinician. The MWT should be performed after the patient's major sleep period. Performance of a PSG before the MWT is at the discretion of the sleep clinician.","The sleep facility performs MWTs in accordance with AASM practice parameters and published guidelines. MWT is indicated to assess a person's ability to remain awake when his or her inability to remain awake constitutes a public or personal safety issue. MWT may be indicated in patients with excessive daytime sleepiness to assess response to treatment. MWT must be ordered or approved by an appropriately licensed facility medical staff member. The physician based on clinical circumstances decides performance of a PSG prior to MWT. MWT trials last 40 minutes. On occasion the staff physician may order 20 minute trials (e.g., for FAA requirements).","A standard MWT protocol that is consistent with AASM practice parameters promotes consistency, allows comparisons between tests, and ensures accurate interpretations that are consistent with published data. The 40-minute MWT protocol may be indicated to assess the ability to stay awake (i.e. for patients with excessive sleepiness to assess response to treatment).

If a mask leak occurs, the tech should first fix the leakage before raising the pressure. Otherwise, the final pressure setting chosen for the patient may be too high. Once the mask leak has been fixed, decrease the pressure to the last setting where mouth breathing and/or mask leakage was not present, and then re- titrate as indicated. Make sure to document directly on the study the steps taken to resolve the leak and the type of masks used. Pressure settings usually do not need to be set as high with a nasal-mask than with a full-face mask. 2. The recoding technologist should document directly on the study at least every 30 minutes. 3. If the patient takes a break from wearing the mask, do not decrease the CPAP pressure on attempted return to sleep unless the patient remains awake for 15 minutes or the patient specifically requests that the pressure be lowered. 4. Do not raise pressure settings for central apneas. If the patient develops central apneas, periodic breathing, pressure setting may need to be lowered. 5. The use of bi-level positive airway pressure may be indicated if the patient is unable to tolerate CPAP secondary due to any of the following: 1) Persistent mouth breathing despite use of a full-face mask/chin strap; 2) Inability to exhale against higher expiratory pressures (typically beginning anywhere from 15 to 20 cm of water); or 3) Frequent central apneas. Document directly on the study why the patient is being switched from CPAP to Bi-PAP. 6. Ensure that supine sleep has been seen on the chosen setting. Going above the chosen setting by one or two cm of water to show range may be helpful to ensure that the correct pressure has been established. Pressure levels may need to be increased more quickly during REM sleep given the limited amount of REM during sleep and the need to treat events during this stage.","Maintain precautions as indicated in the table below when transporting a patient to other areas. Inform the area receiving the patient in advance regarding the need for precautions. When transporting a patient on precautions within the healthcare facility, the appropriate use of barriers to prevent spread of the infectious agent is based upon the mode of transmission and the patient's circumstances (e.g., age, mental status, etc.). For example, because it may be difficult for an infant to wear a mask, the transporter may need to wear a face mask and make arrangements to avoid other patients, staff and visitors in route (such as using an empty elevator).

Use an enteral feeding pump (either Kangaroo® or Medfusion®) for patients who cannot tolerate gravity feeds administered over 20 to 30 minutes. 2. Administer enteral feedings through enteral syringe feeding tubing or through an enteral feeding bag attached directly to the feeding tube. 3. DO NOT use intravenous tubing for enteral feeds to prevent the inadvertent administration of enteral feeding via the intravenous route. 4. Use an enteral syringe and enteral syringe feeding tubing via the Medfusion ® enteral syringe pump to administer human milk feeds and formulas with oil added. Note: Avoid using enteral feeding bags for patients on human milk. When feasible, consider changing the syringe every 2 hours before changing the delivery method to an enteral feeding bag. 5.

How should the catheter be flushed after suctioning and what should be done when thick secretions are present in small diameter airways,1,"1. Explain the procedure to the patient and family. 2. Determine if a second person is needed to assist with the suctioning procedure. Patients described in the High Risk Suctioning Procedure and all patients in the CVICU are suctioned by two people, a combination of nurse, respiratory therapist, NP and/or a physician. 3. Perform hand hygiene and don PPE as described in the Infection Control manual: Hand Hygiene and Standard Precautions policies. 4. Pre-oxygenate prior to suctioning when indicated. 5. Remove the blue cap and attach the suction tubing to the catheter and open the lock. 6. Confirm the level of suction is appropriate for the age of the patient. Suction with vacuum pressures not to exceed -80 mm Hg for neonates, -80 to -100 mm Hg for pediatric patients and -120 mmHg for adult patients. 7. Advance the catheter until a catheter marking is aligned with the same cm marking on the ETT; do not advance the suction catheter more than 1 cm past the end of the artificial airway to prevent irritation/ trauma to the trachea and carina, unless a different depth of suction is specified by a prescriber in a written order. a. NICU patients have a depth of suction card posted at the bedside. b. The depth of suction for patients with a tracheostomy tube is found on the Trach Tube Profile Sheet and the Tracheostomy Assessment section of the HER. 8. Apply suction, wait 3 seconds and then slowly withdraw the catheter while continuously applying suction. Do not exceed 10 seconds with each pass to decrease the potential for oxygen depletion. 9. Flush the catheter with sterile NS until the fluid appears clear in the catheter window. 10. Monitor the patient's vital signs. a. Consider instillation of 0.5 to 1 ml of sterile NS directly into the artificial airway when thick secretions are present and for small diameter airways (e.g., < 4.0 mm). Practice should be done sparingly, when indicated and tolerated. 11. Advance the catheter just into the ETT/tracheostomy and instill. 12. Pull the catheter back to the resting position and allow 2-4 breaths to be delivered, this directs the NS down the ETT. Suction as described above. 13. Repeat the procedure as needed, allowing time to recover between passes of the catheter. 14. When finished suctioning, flush the catheter with sterile NS, close the lock, replace the blue cap to the end of the suction catheter and provide post procedure hyper-oxygenation when indicated. 15. If the instillation of Lidocaine is indicated, follow the above instillation procedure and wait 1-2 minutes for effect.","1. Hold oxygen near patient during procedure. With catheter vent open, introduce catheter into nostril and advance catheter when patient inhales. Apply constant suction by holding thumb over vent while gently withdrawing the catheter. Encourage patient to cough during suctioning. Limit the period of suctioning to 3-6 seconds each time the catheter is inserted. Desaturation may result from lengthy suctioning. 2. Observe for decrease of oxygen saturation or heart rate. Use of oximeter and/or cardiac monitor is useful in monitoring the effect of suctioning. 3. Oxygenate patient if color change is noted or desaturation occurs. 4. Remove excess secretions from mouth with suction catheter as necessary. 5. Observe aspirated secretions for color, consistency and amount of secretions. 6. Repeat suctioning process if necessary. 7. Discard catheter after use . 8. Use Yankauer suctioning for excessive oral secretions at side of mouth.","1. Explain the procedure to the patient and family. 2.

Oro/nasopharyngeal suctioning is a clean procedure. 2. Suctioning effectiveness depends upon type and size of the catheter, the diameter of the area being suctioned, and the efficiency of the suction apparatus. 3. In special circumstances, have a colleague available if assistance in managing the patient may be required. 4. Do not insert suction catheter so deep as to cause bronchospasm and/or cardiac arrest, vagal stimulation, or bradycardia.","The catheter selected should be of the smallest gauge and length with the fewest number of lumens needed to accommodate the prescribed therapy. The appropriate catheter to accommodate the patient's vascular access needs is based upon the prescribed therapy or treatment regime, length of treatment, expected duration of dwell, vascular integrity, and patient/family preference. Ideally, the catheter should be less than half the size of the diameter of the vein, measured with ultrasound after the vein has been warmed and while a tourniquet is applied.",3,4,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

There is an ethical obligation to review these images because incidental findings may be of clinical significance. All investigators are required to: 1. Implement a mechanism to ensure that images are reviewed by an appropriately trained clinician, and 2. Develop a plan for reporting incidental findings as part of their protocol application in a timely manner. a. It is often recommended that investigators consider whether adding a radiologist to the research protocol would assist in the review of images and reporting of information as necessary. b. Even when a radiologist is not part of the research team, investigators need to consider who receives information on incidental findings and how they will be reviewed and reported. c. In general, it is not acceptable to have research coordinators responsible for the receipt of such reports without the oversight and attention of the investigator or other qualified co-investigators.","For joint proceedings with HMS, the final report with its conclusions and recommendations is sent for consideration of the HMS Standing Committee on Faculty Conduct before sharing it with the DO at each institution.

What is the main focus of the document Murmurspdf and why is it important for nurses to understand,0,"• Clinical judgment is the ability of nurses to use their clinical knowledge to affect patient outcome. ◦ It is defined as clinical reasoning, which includes clinical decision-making, critical thinking, and a global grasp of the situation, coupled with nursing skills acquired through a process of integrating formal and experiential knowledge. ◦ Patricia Benner's From Novice to Expert has enriched how the Nursing profession has come to understand clinical knowledge development. ◦ Clinical wisdom is not solely dependent on years of experience but on experience gained from years of learning and applying knowledge gained to each successive patient. • Clinical inquiry involves resolving clinical problems that occur at the bedside and in the care environment. ◦ It is an ongoing process of questioning and evaluating practice and providing informed practice and creating practice changes or innovation through research utilization and experiential learning. ◦ It is a matter of asking good questions, delving into the literature to answer those questions, and bringing the best evidence to the bedside. ◦ Clinical inquiry is all about seeing, questioning, finding the evidence, and making practice changes. • Caring practices makes our clinical judgment visible. Caring practices include a constellation of nursing activities which are responsive to the uniqueness of the patient and family and that create a compassionate and therapeutic environment with the aim of promoting comfort and preventing suffering. ◦ Caring practices, such as presence and vigilance, create a safe environment for patients to be sick in. ◦ Caring practices, extended to all members of the care team, creates a therapeutic milieu. ◦ Caring practices include not only what nurses do but how they do it. ▪ Pain assessment and management are fundamental caring activities. ◦ Nurses are engaged during difficult situations, they help the patient and families understand and decide out how best they can get though tough situations. All patients are unique with different values and beliefs that nurses learn so they can know what is important to the patient and their family. • Response to diversity involves the sensitivity to recognize, appreciate, and incorporate differences in the provision of care. ◦ Differences may include, but are not limited to: individuality, cultural differences, spiritual beliefs, gender, racial, ethnicity, family configuration lifestyle, socioeconomic status, age, values, alternative medicine involving patients/families and members of the healthcare team. ◦ Nurses help families identify, for themselves, what is important to them as individuals and support them though difficult decisions. • Advocacy/moral agency involves working on another's behalf and representing the concerns of the patient/family/community and serving as a moral agent in identifying and helping to resolve ethical and clinical concerns within the clinical setting. ◦ Because of Nursing's unique relationship with patients and families, nurses often are the voice for patients who cannot speak for themselves. ◦ Nurses carry on the moral tradition of nursing and serve as the patient and family's moral agent; the person in whom things matter, the person who takes a stand and gives voice to patient and family concerns. • Facilitator of learning refers to nurses' competency in facilitating patient, family and staff learning. This includes supporting a learning environment characterized by safe discourse, mentoring and team development. ◦ Teaching and patient and family learning is embedded in care. From our first interaction, were we orient patients and family to the care environment, to our last interaction, were we finalize instructions for home self care nurses constantly teach. ◦ We also assume major responsibility in coaching and mentoring the next generation of nurses and members of the multidisciplinary team in the context-dependent aspects of care. • Collaboration includes working with others (patient, family, healthcare providers, colleagues, community) in a way that promotes and encourages each person's contributions. ◦ Collaboration involves intradisciplinary and interdisciplinary work with colleagues and ability to negotiate and resolve conflict. ◦ The nurse is the one person who knows the care environment and can pull a team of caregivers together in the best interest of the patient and family. • Systems' thinking includes appreciating the care environment from a perspective that recognizes the inter-relationships that exist within and across healthcare settings. ◦ Making complex systems safe for patients is a skill. Whereas competent nurses operative on a micro level (unit and shift focus) and are just beginning to develop system savvy and strategies to facilitate change, expert nurses operate on a macro level (program and episode of illness focus), possess system savvy and easily apply a variety of strategies to facilitate change within complex systems.","Our liaison program serves as the link between families and surgeons during the intra-operative period. While families are waiting, the liaison nurse provides frequent updates to the parents/family of the child's progress. The liaison nurse meets the families in POH or in the liaison office prior to surgery and then assigns them a semi-private waiting space. They also provide for the wide variety of needs of diverse array of families seen at BCH. The liaison nurse serves as advocates for families to ensure privacy in communications and respect for differences. Liaison nurses are active members of the multidisciplinary team and collaborate in a professional manner with other team members across disciplines keeping the focus on the care of the patient and family. Liaison nurses assess families from a holistic standpoint and act on information gathered to optimize the family experience to minimize stress, promote physical comfort, and to be able to proactively put supports in place for identified needs.","1.

An investigator's plan for pregnancy testing is to be consistent with the clinical guidelines unless a justified exception is approved by the IRB and the Department Chair or Division Chief. 2. Protocols may not exclude persons based upon their potential to bear children. There must be justified, scientific rationale to exclude persons of childbearing potential. 3. Massachusetts law requires that a positive pregnancy test result be communicated only to the minor and not to their parents without permission. This includes pregnancy test results obtained during the course of research. 4. The IRB sets an age criterion of 12 years or the onset of menses, as a requirement for pregnancy testing in protocols that may potentially affect a fetus. a. If an investigator proposes to perform pregnancy testing for children under the age of 12 or before the onset of menses, the investigator must justify why this is appropriate for the protocol. b. In determining whether it is acceptable to perform pregnancy testing before age 12 or the onset of menses, the IRB considers the potential for direct benefit offered by the protocol within the context of the research. 5. Adolescents under the age of 12 : For subjects under the age of 12 (if required by the protocol), the investigator is to use their discretion as to the subject's knowledge of and exposure to sexual activities in order to determine whether a separate document is reasonable. 6. Adolescents age 12 and older : The IRB strongly recommends that investigators consider the use of a separate document for adolescents age 12 and older, even when assent is not required by the adolescent. This document is to address pregnancy testing and the need to avoid pregnancy only. 7. Any plan for pregnancy testing must be fully disclosed in the informed consent document. The consent is to include: a. The type of pregnancy testing (blood or urine). b. The frequency of testing (prior to the trial, during, both). c. What will happen if results are positive? d. Who will be informed of the results? e. How confidentiality will be maintained? Sample consent form template language describing pregnancy testing is available.","1. Informed consent documents must always be readily accessible. Therefore, where the research is pertinent to clinical care by Boston Children's Hospital or Boston Children's Hospital physicians, investigators must maintain copies of the original informed consent document in research records as well as the medical record. 2. In the event commercial sponsors require the original informed consent document to be filed with a research binder, the Medical Records Department will accept a copy of the subject's signed informed consent in lieu of the original. In order to determine the manner of storage, it is important to understand sponsor requirements prior to initiating a study. 3. Investigators also must take into consideration the possibility that a consent document could be misplaced and not make its way to the medical record. For that reason, investigators may choose to store the original consent in their research records.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1

The accompanying anesthesia provider is responsible for the care of the patient until vital signs are determined to be stable and report has been given to the PACU nurse. 3. The primary nurse is assisted by a helper (second nurse or clinical assistant.) The helper is responsible for obtaining blood pressure and temperature, and placing the patient on the cardiorespiratory monitor. During an admission where a second PACU assistant is not available, the OR team may assist in the admission to expedite the process. 4. The PACU admitting team verbally reports temperature to the anesthesia provider who ensures that this is electronically documented in AIMS record. All other vital signs will download electronically into the AIMS record from the monitor. 5. The primary nurse takes report from the OR nurse and then from a member of the anesthesia team. When it is determined that the patient's vital signs are stable and the patient is placed on monitors. 6. The primary nurse takes report from the surgeon/proceduralist and assures that orders are written. 7. The helper continues to settle the patient and complete admission tasks, i.e., getting warm blankets and pillows, elevating appropriate extremities, checking orders for the IV and setting it up, checking for PCA orders, emptying drains.",4,3,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
According to the PHS Policy what is the focus of the policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals,0,"Species Covered: All Vertebrate Species Pain and distress are inevitable in an animal research environment. A major focus of this policy and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) is to ensure that pain and/or distress are minimized whenever and however possible. 1. What Constitutes Pain and Distress a. The following are examples of procedures that have the potential to be painful and/or distressful based on PHS Policy, Animal Welfare Regulations/USDA Policy and the National Research Council's Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals: i. Any procedure that would cause pain or distress in humans can cause pain and distress in other animals ii. Use of Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) iii. Propagation of tumor cells that exceeds what is outlined in the Tumor Production Policy 2. IACUC Review a. To help the IACUC determine whether pain and/or distress caused by protocol procedures will be minimized, the investigator must provide the following information: i. Whether the procedure constitutes more than momentary pain or distress. If it does, a literature search containing keywords for the potentially painful procedure must be performed to ensure that less painful/distressful alternatives are not available. For example, a protocol involving cardiac surgery would include keywords such as: thoracotomy, sternotomy. A separate search must be performed for each potentially painful/distressful procedure. ii. What analgesics (including dosages and routes of administration) will be used to alleviate pain iii. Who will be monitoring the animals and what level of training they have iv. Frequency of monitoring, both immediately post-procedure and in the longer term v. If pain can not be alleviated because of negative effects on the investigator's data, scientific justification must be provided and end points must be defined. A clear clinical picture of what the animal is expected to look like must be provided. 3. Recognition of Pain and Distress a. The next fundamental component to controlling or minimizing pain is the recognition of clinical signs associated with pain. Although each species responds differently to pain, some general characteristics can be used to assess pain in all animals: i. While under sedation or anesthesia, good indicators of pain are an elevated heart rate, increase in blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and response to noxious stimuli. ii. In animals recovering from procedures, good indicators are lethargy, depression, reduced appetite, vocalization, restlessness, inability to move or stand, elevated body temperature, and any other abnormal behaviors. b. For more species-specific clinical criteria to assess pain and distress, refer to the Children's Hospital Animal Research Investigator's Manual or consult with an ARCH veterinarian. 4. Alleviation of Pain and Distress a. Pain is inevitable, but all possible measures must be taken to minimize animal discomfort and distress. Animals that exhibit signs of pain while under anesthesia or sedation can be managed by increasing the level of anesthetic depth or administering an approved analgesic. b. Animals recovering from painful procedures must be treated peri-procedurally with an approved analgesic, and then as needed, depending on clinical signs, but not less than what is specified in the Animal Use Protocol. Analgesia is to be administered by an approved member of the protocol. However, the Attending Veterinarian or designee will require analgesics to be used if he/she feels it is necessary. Investigators are responsible for ensuring animals are provided with appropriate analgesia following painful procedures. Laboratories should have a backup plan in place should the investigator primarily responsible for administering analgesia not be available. Investigators must contact ARCH staff if extenuating situations arise that might prevent administration of analgesia as specified in the Animal Use Protocol. After hours, ARCH may be contacted via the ARCH on call phone (617-828-4766). c. The Children's Hospital Animal Research Investigator's Manual provides a list of recommended analgesics and dosages. In addition, investigators are also encouraged to consult with the ARCH veterinarians prior to submitting a protocol to the IACUC for review. 5. Procedures in Which Analgesia Cannot be Administered a. In certain experimental situations, pain and distress are not able to be relieved because of the negative influences this may have on the experimental results. b. The protocol submission for procedures in which analgesia cannot be administered requires the same documentation as stated earlier in this policy. The investigator must explain and scientifically justify the reasons that the animals cannot receive relief from pain and distress. The investigator must also explain the impact of the use of chemical agents on the study. The investigator must supply the results of a literature search verifying that less painful alternatives are not possible. Keywords for each potentially painful procedure must be included. c. In protocols in which pain and distress cannot be alleviated, it is still essential to minimize and reduce animal suffering. The policy requires that in these unique circumstances, the investigator and members of the protocol establish explicit written parameters that will be strictly enforced to determine when the animal will be euthanized to prevent extreme or unnecessary pain and discomfort. A clinical picture must be established as to how the animals will look during the procedure, including such things as hair loss, weight loss, diarrhea, ascites, or any other physical changes expected. The following list is suggestions as to when euthanasia should be considered in these animals: i. When any animal has a reduction of greater than 15-20% of their baseline body weight an overall assessment must be done immediately to determine the cause of cachexia. Animals must be weighed on a daily basis until there is no further cause for pain and/or distress. Supplemental care may be a solution to this weight loss and should be performed based on the advice of the veterinary staff. In tumor production protocols, animal weights must be recorded at least twice weekly until the animals are euthanized. ii. When an animal's mobility is compromised in any way that interferes with its ability to eat, drink, urinate, defecate, or ambulate, the animal must be immediately assessed. Euthanasia must be considered. iii. In studies including propagation of tumor lines, a clear demarcation of tumor size and character must be defined regarding when euthanasia will be performed. When a tumor ulcerates, causes any interference with mobility, or becomes greater than 10-15% of the animal's body weight, euthanasia must be considered. 6. Assessment of Animal Status a. Miscellaneous parameters which can be used at the discretion of the investigators to assess the status of animals are listed below: i. Temperature ranges may be used to determine when animals are significantly compromised and as indicators for when euthanasia is required. In order for this to be effective, investigators must determine normal body temperatures for the species they are using, and which temperatures indicate significant postoperative complications. ii. Blood values also can be of use depending on the procedures which were done. Significantly elevated white cell counts could indicate severe stress or illness, and can help establish points of euthanasia. Anemia can also be used as a marker of illness associated with the procedure. Certain enzymes which are organ-specific can help indicate problems an animal may be experiencing secondary to a procedure. b. All methods for pain and distress assessment must be recorded in the animal's postoperative care form. It is at the discretion of the Attending Veterinarian or designee as to when treatment or euthanasia is required, if it is not appropriately handled by the investigators. 7. Neuromuscular Blocking Agents a. Neuromuscular agents, such as succinyl choline, are not anesthetic or analgesic agents and do not alleviate pain. Therefore constant monitoring is required. These agents are generally used to paralyze skeletal muscle during surgery. b. When these agents are utilized, many signs used for pain assessment, such as involuntary movement or the palpebral reflex, are eliminated. Sudden changes in heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and response to noxious stimuli, however, can still be used to determine the depth of anesthesia and/or as indicators of pain. If measurement of these parameters are not available to ensure that anesthetic and analgesic delivery are adequate while paralyzed, the paralytic agent may need to be removed periodically and the vital signs of the animals observed. Other methods for assessing the level of anesthesia include the use of peripheral nerve stimulators and the Isolated Limb Technique. c. For more information on the use of these agents, please refer to the institutional policy regarding the Use of Neuromuscular Blockers (NMB's). 8. Palliative Measures to Alleviate Pain or Distress a. In cases where additional measures, or measures to substitute for analgesics are necessary, it is important to determine whether an alteration in the environment may help minimize pain or distress. b. Nestlets, for example, are useful for anxious or first time rodent mothers. These allow the animals to hide themselves and their pups away from personnel, activity, etc., thereby minimizing the animal's anxiety. c. Animals having back or spinal surgery may benefit from having food placed on the floor of the cage or longer sipper tubes placed on their water bottles. These measures will minimize uncomfortable or painful movement of the injured area. d. Animals with neuropathic pain may require special handling. The communication between investigators and ARCH staff of special care needs will minimize unnecessary trauma. e. Rodents with sciatic nerve ligation may need special care for their feet, such as bandaging or the application of a noxious substance to minimize self trauma. f. In any situation in which analgesics cannot be used or appear to be insufficient, the investigator should contact an ARCH veterinarian to discuss further measures to minimize pain or distress","Species Covered: All Vertebrate Species Public Health Service (PHS) Policy requires institutions to establish and maintain proper measures to ensure the appropriate care and use of all animals involved in research, research training, and biological testing activities conducted or supported by the PHS. The PHS endorses the ""U.S. Government Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing, Research and Training,"" which state that, ""Investigators and other personnel shall be appropriately qualified and experienced for conducting procedures on living animals. Adequate arrangements shall be made for their in-service training, including the proper and humane care and use of laboratory animals."" 1. The Animal Welfare Act (AWA) contains several statements in 9 CFR 2.32 regarding training requirements and personnel qualifications: a. 2.32(a) ""It shall be the responsibility of the research facility to ensure that all scientists, research technicians, animal technicians, and other personnel involved in animal care, treatment, and use are qualified to perform their duties..."" b. 2.32(b) ""Training and instruction shall be made available, and the qualifications of personnel reviewed, with sufficient frequency to fulfill the research facility's responsibilities..."" c. 2.32(c) ""Training and instruction of personnel must include guidance in at least the following areas: i. Humane methods of animal maintenance and experimentation, including the basic needs of each species of animal, proper handling and care for the various species of animals used by the facility, proper pre-procedural and post-procedural care of animals, and aseptic surgical methods and procedures. ii. The concept, availability, and use of research or testing methods that limit the use of animals or minimize animal distress. iii. Proper use of anesthetics, analgesics, and tranquilizers for any species of animals used by the facility. iv. Methods whereby deficiencies in animal care and treatment are reported. v. Utilization of services available to provide information on appropriate methods of animal care and use, on alternatives to the use of live animals in research, that could prevent unintended and unnecessary duplication of research involving animals. 2. The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals states that ""Animal welfare regulations and PHS Policy require institutions to ensure that people caring for or using animals are qualified to do so"" and ""Investigators, technical personnel, trainees, and visiting investigators who perform animal anesthesia, surgery, or other experimental manipulations must be qualified through training or experience to accomplish these tasks in a humane and scientifically acceptable manner."" 3. Research Personnel a. Training requirements for research personnel are met in two ways. Typically, research personnel must complete Animal Use Orientation prior to working with research animals, being added to a protocol, or obtaining ARCH access. Occasionally, the training requirements of research personnel may be met without the investigator completing a formal orientation session. For example, if the investigator will be performing the entire procedure supervised by the ARCH veterinary staff, working with animals in a teaching or training protocol, or providing instruction on equipment use. b. Secondly, in order for an investigator to be added to a protocol, the PI must complete an Add Staff Form, indicating what procedures the investigator will be performing, and the investigator's training and experience, as it relates to the procedures involved. Add Staff Forms that do not contain this information are not approved until the PI provides the relevant information. 4. ARCH Personnel a. When an Animal Care Technician first begins working in ARCH, management staff review departmental policies and procedures with them, as well as an ARCH safety presentation. The new Animal Care Technician then works with and are trained by another individual, experienced in the area they will be assigned to. A Lead Animal Care Technician for that area is responsible for oversight and completes a form that indicates what training the new employee has received, who provided the training, and the date on which the training was completed. b. In addition to on-the-job training, all ARCH Animal Care Technicians attend biweekly meetings on animal care and use. Topics include diseases in laboratory animals, the recognition and detection of disease or illness in animals, safety issues, review of the ARCH evacuation plan, zoonoses, and various husbandry and regulatory issues. Additionally, the staff review policy, procedure, and program changes and/or updates. Back Safety Workshops are held to train ARCH staff to use proper procedures for lifting, pushing, and pulling, in order to prevent back injuries. c. Boston Children's Hospital is an Institutional Member of American Association for Laboratory Animal Science (AALAS). An AALAS Certification Preparatory Course is offered annually at MIT. Boston Children's Hospital pays the tuition for ARCH personnel to attend this course as well as the certification exam fees. In the annual performance review, a portion of the animal care technicians' merit increases are based on their ability to maintain and expand appropriate animal care and use knowledge and skills. AALAS Certification is one way to achieve recognition of development and is strongly encouraged.",ARCH: Animal Resources at Children's Hospital BCH: Boston Children's Hospital IACUC: Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee PHS Policy: Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals,"Species Covered: All Vertebrate Species This document provides guidance by which protocol submissions are reviewed by the IACUC. 1. Types of Submissions a. All work with vertebrate animals must be covered by an IACUC-approved Animal Use Protocol (AUP). Animal work must be carried out as described in the protocol. Investigators are not permitted to do work that is not described in the approved protocol. b. The initial submission is known as a New Protocol . This must be approved by the IACUC before any animal work, including ordering animals, can begin. c. If there is need to deviate from the approved protocol, investigators must submit an Amendment for review and approval by the IACUC prior to instituting any of the proposed changes. d. Investigators must also provide an Annual Renewal (annual progress report) for review each year, for protocols using species regulated by the USDA or for which funding requirements mandate annual renewal. Protocol requiring annual renewal must be submitted for review prior to their anniversary date to avoid being placed on Administrative Hold. (See Administrative Hold policy for exceptions.) e. Every three years, investigators must submit a 3-Year Rewrite . This fully rewritten protocol is treated the same way as a New Protocol, including the assignment of a new protocol number. 2. Types of Reviews a. In order to approve proposed research projects or proposed changes to ongoing research projects, the IACUC conducts a review of those components related to the care and use of animals. The IACUC must determine that the proposed research projects are described and will be conducted in accordance with all applicable requirements, including: i. Public Health Service (PHS) Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (PHS Policy) ii. Children's PHS Animal Welfare Assurance iii. The Animal Welfare Act (AWA) iv. The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Guide), unless acceptable justification for a departure from the Guide is approved by the IACUC. b. There are two main IACUC review methods to fulfill USDA and PHS requirements—Full Committee and Designated Member Review. Submissions that do not meet the regulatory requirements for Full Committee or Designated Member Review can undergo Administrative Review. Administrative reviews (as below) are acceptable for annual renewals for protocols not regulated by the Animal Welfare Act and for changes to approved protocols that do not meet regularity criteria for FCR or DMR. Significant changes described below, must be approved by FCR or DMR, including changes: i. from nonsurvival to survival surgery; ii. resulting in greater pain, distress, or degree of invasiveness; iii. in housing and or use of animals in a location that is not part of the animal program overseen by the IACUC; iv. in species; v. in study objectives; vi. in Principal Investigator (PI); and vii. that impact personnel safety. 3. Full-Committee review (FCR) a. Review by a quorum of the IACUC at a convened meeting. The primary reviewer (and secondary reviewer, if assigned) summarize the submission and suggest an action (see Committee Actions below), then a discussion with the full committee ensues to reach a consensus. Any type of submission may be reviewed by FCR. 4. Designated Member Review (DMR) a. Review outside of a convened meeting. Each member is provided with access to a copy of the submission and has two (2) business days (at least 48 hours) to request full committee review, but this time frame may be modified at the discretion of the IACUC Chairperson. A lack of a reply is equivalent to declining to call for FCR. If full committee review is not requested, at least one member of the IACUC, designated by the Chairperson and qualified to conduct the review, shall review the submission and have the authority to approve, require modifications in (to secure approval), or request full committee review of the submission. Designated member reviewers cannot defer or reject a submission. Instead, the reviewer must request full committee review. b. Submissions are distributed to the IACUC following published deadlines. In the event a submission must be reviewed between deadlines, it may be approved for out-of-cycle (""expedited"") DMR review but the PI must explicitly request this type of review and justify why it is necessary. 5. Administrative Review a. Submissions that do not meet the regulatory requirements for FCR or DMR are eligible for administrative review. These reviews are coordinated through the APSA Office and are performed by a member of the APSA office, with the exception of item 7 below, which requires an ARCH veterinarian. b. The following types of submissions are eligible for Administrative Review: i. Add Staff Requests : Protocol Associates other than the PI are added to a protocol via the pre- formatted Add Staff Request email form (available on the APSA website). All PI changes must be made via FCR or DMR. ii. Addition of new fish, mouse and rat strains to the animal protocol, assuming the following requirements are met : 1. Changes to the number of animals approved in the protocol are not required 2. The newly proposed strain does not have a phenotype that requires special housing, husbandry or veterinary-related considerations (e.g., prone to epilepsy, brittle bones, spontaneous tumor growth, embryonic or neonatal lethality, etc.) 3. The new strain will be used in procedures previously approved in the active protocol iii. Annual Renewal for non-USDA covered species iv. Correction of typographical errors v. Correction of grammar vi. Contact information updates vii. Specific significant changes meeting the requirements in NIH notice NOT-OD-14-063 ( https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-14-126.html) may be handled administratively on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the PHS Policy Iv.C.1.a-g in consultation with any of the ARCH veterinarians, who will serve as a subject matter expert to verity that compliance with the IACUC-reviewed and –approved policy and is appropriate for the animals in each circumstance. The change(s) to the protocol must be documented and the veterinarian may refer any requested change to the IACUC for review for any reason and must refer any request that does not meet the parameters of the IACUC-reviewed and –approved policies. These include changes in: 1. Anesthesia, analgesia, or sedation as approved in IACUC policy, described in the BCH Animal Research Investigator's manual, or in any previously-approved animal protocol by the BCH IACUC 2. Euthanasia to any method approved in the current AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals viii. An increase in previously approved animal numbers, not to exceed 10% of the total number of animals previously approved by the IACUC for that protocol. ix. New animal use locations outside of centralized facilities in the Enders Research Laboratories, Karp Family Research Laboratories or the Center for Life Sciences. 6. Review of Responses a. Submissions that are not fully approved via FCR or DMR require a response from the PI. Responses are reviewed by at least one member of the IACUC to confirm that all concerns were appropriately addressed. If a submission is initially reviewed by FCR and requires modifications in order to secure approval, it is reviewed consistent with NIH's ""Guidance to IACUCs Regarding Use of Designated Member Review (DMR) for Animal Study Proposal Review Subsequent to Full Committee Review (FCR)"" (NOT-OD-09-035). Requests that can be addressed by simple compliance by the PI (e.g., submitting a signature, updating a clearance) can be reviewed administratively. b. Any changes requested during administrative review will be performed by the PI and the personnel responsible for that review. 7. Committee Actions a. Submissions reviewed via FCR will have one of the following outcomes: i. Approval (APP) : The proposal is approved. The processing of the submission by APSA is dependent upon receipt of the PI's electronic signature and/or current clearance dates. If the submission is missing the PI's electronic signature or clearances are not current, the submission will be processed administratively. ii. Requires Administrative Modifications (RAM) : Problems regarding the proposal are administrative or minor in nature. The investigator's response to the IACUC's concerns is reviewed via DMR Subsequent to FCR. iii. Requires Modifications (RM) : Problems regarding the proposal are not of a serious nature. The investigator's response to the IACUC's concerns is reviewed via DMR Subsequent to FCR. iv. Deferral (DEF) : Changes proposed or questions raised by the Committee are significant enough to warrant rewriting of the proposal, and investigator response to be reviewed at a subsequent meeting. v. Rejection (REJ) : The protocol is lacking in scientific merit in relation to potential pain, discomfort, or distress experienced by the animal. b. Submissions reviewed via DMR can be approved or require modifications (with or without administrative modifications), as described above. They cannot be deferred or rejected; instead, the designated member reviewer must request full committee review. 8. Reporting a. At each convened meeting the IACUC is provided with a list of submissions that underwent DMR since the last meeting.","This Policy sets forth BCH's policy and procedures to implement the PHS Rules at BCH, including the disclosure of SFIs and the management of FCOIs, both as defined below.",1,4,2,3,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0

All members are provided with a copy of the amendment/revision request form with the proposed changes listed along with the rationale for the change. 1. Each amendment is assigned a primary and a secondary reviewer. a. Reviewers get a Reviewer Worksheet that needs to be completed and submitted at the end of the meeting. 2. The CHeRP system allows members to review side-by-side the sections of the SmartForm and attached materials that have been changed. a. Revised consents and recruitment notices are submitted in tracked changes to improve efficiency and effectiveness of the review process. 3. The voting procedures listed above apply to the review and voting process for amendments/revisions.,"A proposed change in research related activities may be approved through expedited review procedures if: 1. it does not: a. materially affect an assessment of the risks and benefits of the study and b. does not substantially change the specific aims or design of the study may be approved through expedited review procedures. 2. it includes changes minor changes to previously approved research. Expedited review will be performed by the IRB Chair, Vice Chair, or designated experienced IRB member. 1. The expedited reviewer who is performing the expedited review has electronic access via CHeRP to the amendment request which specifies the requested changes and any revised documents. 2. The expedited reviewer may ask for further justification from the Principal Investigator (PI) for the requested amendment. a. If there are questions or concerns that the PI needs to address, the IRB administrator will communicate these concerns to the PI. 3. If there are no issues for the PI to address, the amendment can be approved. As part of the expedited review, the reviewer will determine whether the amendment qualifies as: 1. A minor modification or 2. An amendment that qualifies for expedited review and if subjects who have previously enrolled in the research should be provided with information about the amendment. This occurs when such information may impact a subject's willingness to participate in the research. The expedited reviewer will also determine whether they wish to see the investigator's revisions or if the IRB administrators may verify that the changes have been made. Amendments that are approved through expedited review are summarized and provided to the convened IRB on a monthly basis. Minor Modifications Examples Examples of minor modifications may include: 1. Changes in the research staff/personnel for a protocol 2. Non-substantive revisions in the informed consent document 3. Revisions or modifications in the informed consent to provide better clarification 4. Changes to improve the clarity of statements or to correct typographical errors, provided that such changes do not alter the content or intent of a statement 5. The substitution of assessments with alternate assessments that present minimal risk 6. An increase or decrease in proposed human research subject enrollment supported by a statistical justification 7. Narrowing the range of inclusion criteria 8. Broadening the range of exclusion criteria only if the risk/benefit assessment remains unchanged 9. Decreasing the number or volume of biological sample collections, provided that such a change does not affect the collection of information related to safety evaluations 10. An increase in the length of confinement or number of study visits for the purpose of increased safety monitoring, provided the risk/benefit ratio does not change. 11. A decrease in the length of confinement or number of study visits, provided that such a decrease does not affect the collection of data related to safety evaluations 12. Alterations in human research subject payment that do not add any element of undue influence 13. Addition of recruitment notices, recruitment sites, or a population, provided there is no change in the risk/ benefit determination","New research protocol applications that do not meet the criteria for exemption or expedited review are placed on the agenda for convened IRB review. Protocols are discussed on an individual basis. 1. All protocols are submitted electronically and made available to IRB members through the CHeRP system. a. All IRB members have full access to the complete submission under review. b. The electronic submission utilizes a series of SmartForms that request specific information for all protocols (e.g. research team, financial disclosure, funding information) and then branch to other forms as necessary for the category of research under consideration. i. Document uploads are in multiple sections of the SmartForms where the research team can provide complete information required for IRB review.","Continuing Review Applicability Research approved prior to January 21, 2019 and all FDA regulated research approved before or after 1/21/ 2019. 1. Research approved at a convened IRB meeting or through expedited review prior to January 21, 2019 and all FDA regulated research will undergo continuing review. 2. Protocols originally approved at a convened IRB meeting may undergo expedited continuing review: a. When: i. The research is permanently closed to the enrollment of new subjects and ii. All the subjects have completed all research-related interventions; and iii. The research remains active only for long term follow-up of subjects; or b. Where no subjects have been enrolled and no additional risks have been identified; or c. Where remaining research activities are limited to data analysis 3. Continuing review may be conducted through expedited procedures, if: a. It is non-FDA regulated research, (not conducted under investigational new drug application or investigational device exemption), and b. Where the permitted expedited categories do not apply, but the IRB has determined and documented at a convened meeting that the research i. Involves no greater than minimal risk a nd ii. No additional risks have been identified. 4. Review will be conducted at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less than once per year. Time Interval Upon initial review of a protocol, the IRB determines the time interval for the next continuing review. Review must occur within 1-year of the last approval date for a protocol to remain active; however, the IRB may decide more frequent review is necessary. 1. Convened IRB : For a protocol reviewed by the convened IRB, continuing review must occur within 1 year of the protocol being approved at a convened IRB meeting. 2. Expedited Review : For a protocol approved under expedited review that still requires Continuing Review, the review must occur within 1 year of the date the IRB Chair or designated IRB member(s) provide initial approval. More Frequent Review More frequent review may be based on a specific time interval or on a requirement to report back after a specified number of participants have been studied. In making the determination that more frequent review is required, the IRB takes into consideration: 1. The risk of the protocol and 2. The type of information the IRB would like to receive in order to assure appropriate oversight on an ongoing basis. Criteria used to consider whether more frequent review is required includes the following : 1. High-risk protocols where there is concern about significant adverse events that may be permanent, irreversible, or disabling, or that may significantly compromise the research subject. 2. Protocols where the potential risks are completely unknown, unless the minutes document that approval is granted for 1 year. 3. Protocols that involve newborns that include conditions for which it is not possible to perform studies in older children. 4. Protocols submitted with data from preliminary studies that raise concern regarding the possibility of serious adverse events. If more frequent review is required, the investigator will be informed through the approval notification and the CHeRP system will be set to notify the investigator at the required time. At the time of continuing review, the convened IRB or expedited reviewer will assure that all criteria for approval of research continue to be met. Review Tracking The IRB administrative office is responsible for tracking continuing reviews and for notifying investigators when review is required. The Continuing Review SmartForm must be submitted and approved prior to the protocol's expiration date. Principal Investigators (PIs) must submit the continuing review with ample time for the IRB to address any needed questions and revisions. 1. Three months before the protocol's expiration, the CHeRP system will send an automated notice to the PI and research team. 2. If the continuing review is not received, then a. A second notice will be sent at 2 months before the expiration date. b. A third notice will be sent 1 month before the expiration date. Continuing Review: Expedited and Convened IRB Review Process Expedited Review Continuing reviews which qualify for expedited review may be reviewed through the expedited review procedures. Convened IRB All continuing reviews which do not qualify for expedited review are placed on the agenda for the convened IRB meeting. The IRB will use the same criteria and take the same actions described in the IRB policy, 1. One IRB reviewer is assigned to each continuing review. 2. No member with a conflict of interest may serve as a reviewer. 3. All members can access the continuing review submission via CHeRP. Through CHeRP, IRB members have electronic access to the complete IRB protocol file and relevant IRB minutes, including amendments/modifications, unanticipated problems, and previous continuing review approvals. 4. The Continuing Review SmartForm includes: a. The number of subjects accrued: i. Enrolled (signed consent form) ii. Withdrawn due to subject request iii. Withdrawn due to toxicity/adverse events iv. Lost to follow-up v. Completed study (without events leading to early termination) vi. Currently active on study vii. Other category b. Removed for ineligibility c. A summary of adverse events and any unanticipated problems that involve risks to subjects or others, and any withdrawal of subjects from the research or complaints about the research since the last IRB review. d. If applicable: i. A summary of any relevant recent literature and interim findings. ii. Data and safety monitoring reports may be submitted. iii. Any relevant multi-center trial reports. iv. Monitoring reports from sponsors. e. Any other relevant information, particularly information about risks associated with the research. f. Links to the currently approved protocol, recruitment documents, and informed consent documents. g. Information regarding reliance arrangements 5. IRB members are provided with a continuing review Reviewer Worksheet to complete. When reviewing the current informed consent document, the IRB ensures that : a. The currently approved or proposed consent document is still accurate and complete; and b. Any significant new findings that may relate to the subject's willingness to continue to participate are provided to the subject. 6. The IRB may request and rely on a current statement from the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) or the sponsor that indicates it has reviewed study-wide adverse events, interim findings, and any recent literature that may be relevant to the research, in lieu of requiring that this information be submitted directly to the IRB. 7. In general, when taking an action of conditional approval at the time of continuing review, any noted conditions need to be satisfied before an investigator may continue research activities related to the conditions specified. a. During the continuing review, the IRB may make determinations that currently enrolled subjects may continue, but no new subjects may be enrolled until a designated IRB member reviews a revised protocol and verifies that conditions are met. 8. After the convened IRB meeting, the investigator is sent notification of the action taken. a. When approved, the informed consent dates are modified to reflect the new period of approval and expiration.","Protocols are to be maintained as referenced above for all expedited review approvals. 1. Each month a report is to be generated that summarizes the new, continuing review, and amendment expedited reviews conducted during the month. This report is to include: the title of the protocol, the name of the PI, a summary of the amendment or revision, and the category of expedited review for each new protocol as defined by federal regulations. 2. The report is to be submitted to the full IRB for review at a convened meeting.",4,3,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

The interaction is synergistic; specifically, it is reciprocating and co-constituting. The nurse comes to ""know"" the patient and family and the patient and family comes to ""know"" the nurse. When the relationship is in-sync, that is, when it is synergistic then optimal patient outcomes are more apt to occur. Because we believe that excellence in care is provided through meaningful therapeutic relationships with patients and their families, continuity in care is a core element of our model of care. • In support of fostering therapeutic patient/family-nurse relationships, the Charge and Staff Nurses work together to build continuity in nursing care over the patient's illness trajectory by assigning a limited number of nurses to the patient/family. • As colleagues, more experienced nurses mentor less experienced nurses. • Since the needs of patients vary across the system, we have a varying number of Level I, II, and III Staff Nurses and Advanced Practice Nurses who provide varying levels of expertise on each unit to best accommodate patient needs.","Staffing plans are developed based on the American Nurses Association (ANA) principles of Nurse Staffing. The principles address patient care unit related, staff related and institution/organization related activities.

Registered nurses range in experience from new graduate nurses to many staff with over 20 years clinical practice of pediatric experience. The nurses on 7 West work 8 and 12 hour shifts to provide maximum support of the patient flow on the unit. As a medical unit, the majority of our patients are admitted between 5 pm and 1 am. The combination of 8 and 12 hour shifts provide additional staff during peak times. Unit resources such as patient experience representatives are considered when planning staffing. Staffing plans are arranged to accommodate the specific patient populations on 7 West. The charge nurse from the off going shift picks the assignment with input from the staff nurses based on experience, consistency and the mix of acuity of each patient.

The Sedation Service staffed by Emergency Medicine & Critical Care physicians credentialed to provide procedural sedation to inpatients and outpatients who require placement of Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters (PICC lines), lumbar puncture, bone marrow biopsy, skin biopsy, joint aspiration, or other minor procedures.","Ratios of procedural patient care are based on the Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates (SGNA) Minimum Registered Nurse Staffing for Patient Care in the Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Unit (SGNA, 2012). The GPU staffing plan provides technical support for GI procedures using Endoscopy Technicians. Post Anesthesia Care nursing ratios are based in the American Society of Peri Anesthesia Nurses (ASPAN) Position Statement on Minimum Staffing in Phase I PACU and Patient Classification/Recommended Staffing Guidelines (ASPAN, 2007) Staffing plans are developed based on the American Nurses Association principles of Nurse Staffing. The principles address patient care unit related, staff related and institution/organization related activities. Patient care related activities should reflect the needs of the patients, a staffing plan must consider the number of patients and the level of care required while incorporating physical and psychosocial limitations. For staff related activities, the principle needs of the patient populations should determine the competencies required of the nurse practicing. Staff skill mix and competencies, as well as leadership and organizational support guide this process. The hospital has policies to support the needs of patients and nursing staff. Thus, these policies recognize the myriad needs for both patients and nursing staff (ANA, 1999).","Bedside procedures performed in the Medical Intensive Care Unit included, but are not limited to: • Central line placement • Arterial line placement • Chest tube placement • Intubation and extubation • Bronchoscopy performed by Pulmonology • Airway visualization performed by Otolaryngology",1,3,4,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1

What is the definition of Enhanced Recovery after Surgery ERAS u00ae  according to the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists,0,"Many surgeons now utilize service-specific ERAS protocols. According to the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists (n.d.),: Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS ® ) refers to patient-centered, evidence-based, multidisciplinary team developed pathways for a surgical specialty and facility culture to reduce the patient's surgical stress response, optimize their physiologic function, and facilitate recovery. These care pathways form an integrated continuum, as the patient moves from home through the pre-hospital / preadmission, preoperative, intraoperative, andpostoperative phases of surgery and home again. Depending on the timing of a patient's pre-op visits, the family may not be aware of the ERAS protocol prior to the PCCC visit or SDWU call. Consequently, they will require focused patient-family education during the pre- op visit or phone call.","• ERAS protocols exist for the following procedures: ◦ ACL IT Band ◦ Abdominal Surgery ◦ Bladder Exstrophy ◦ PAO ◦ Orthognathic Procedures with OMFS Team ◦ Gender Affirming Chest Reconstructive Surgery ◦ Reduction Mammoplasty (not for Dr. Ganke's patients as of 9/19/22) • ERAS should be noted on the OR booking sheet ◦ If ERAS is NOT noted on the OR booking sheet, contact the surgeon and/or associated PA/NP to confirm if the patient will be on the ERAS protocol • To access a surgical service's ERAS protocol, follow the steps below: ◦ BCH Homepage > Departments & Programs > Anesthesiology, Critical Care and Pain Medicine > Clinical Guidelines & Policies > Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) • During care coordination, RN/NP staff should: ◦ Note ""ERAS"" in the following sections of the PAEF: ▪ Special Needs ▪ Anesthesia Pre-Op Discussion ▪ Nursing Communication ◦ Print a copy of the appropriate service-specific ERAS protocol and place it in the patient's paper chart for review at the pre-op visit • During the pre-op visit/phone call, the RN/NP should: ◦ Review the pre-op portion of the ERAS protocol ◦ Refer the family to the surgeon and/or anesthesiologist for additional questions related to ERAS","• Patients require a pre-op visit in the Perioperative Care Coordination Clinic ~2 weeks prior to surgery (patients are no longer pre-admitted to the hospital for bowel prep) • All patients require the following pre-op labs: ◦ CBC ◦ Chem 10 ◦ PT/PTT ◦ Extended Type and Crossmatch (2 units PRBC) if drawn > 3 days prior to surgery and patient has not had a blood transfusion • Patients follow the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Protocol for Bladder Exstrophy ( Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Protocol for Bladder Exstrophy.pdf (chboston.org) ) ◦ This should appear on the OR booking sheet ◦ Note ""ERAS"" in the ""Pre-operative Discussion"" and ""Nursing Communication"" sections of the PAEF • After anesthesia induction, an extended dwell IV will be be placed for both long term IV access and intraop blood draws (patients no longer receive a PICC) • Surgery takes place over the course of two days ◦ Day 1: Ortho component (e.g. B/L iliac osteotomies, SPICA cast placement) ◦ Day 2: Urology component (e.g. bladder closure)","Consistent with the rest of Children's Hospital Boston, the Synergy Professional Model of Care guides patient care delivery.

Trophic feeding has not been associated with an increased risk for NEC. • Trophic feeding should be started as soon as possible after birth if there are no absolute contraindications. Withholding feeds for more than 4 days has been associated with adverse effects on growth, delayed time to reach full enteral feeds, and longer PN dependence, with no reduction in NEC incidence. • What to feed (in order of preference): ◦ Mother's own colostrum or milk ◦ Donor human milk may be used as a ""bridge"" until mother's own colostrum or milk is available according to the Use of Donor Human Milk policy ◦ Donor milk is also used if mother's own milk is unavailable or supply is not adequate to meet infant's needs, per Use of Donor Human Milk ◦ 20 kcal/oz. formula appropriate to gestational age (if mother's own milk is not available and donor milk has been declined) • How much to feed: ◦ 10 ml/kg/day (regardless of birth weight or gestational age) ◦ Do not advance volume or caloric density until infant is clinically ready to transition to nutritive feedings; no absolute or relative contraindications","The following clinical activities are managed by the appropriate positions on the HICS organizational chart and/or their designees: • Scheduling • Triage • Assessment • Treatment • Support Services • Admission • Transfer • Discharge Inpatients may be evaluated for early discharge upon activation of applicable emergency plans.

Using the Oxygenator and Tubing Pack Selection charts to choose the components that best fit the planned procedure taking into account the patient history. Consult team members and planned primary perfusionist for circuits at the limits for a given situation. 5. The following set up standards should be used when selecting circuit components in advance of the day of surgery. Active Ultrafiltration Only : means that we are using the sixth pump head with a boot line connecting the venous limb to the hemoconcentrator. The hemoconcentrator outlet is connected to a valved purge line and runs to the CVR. This set up also allows for passive ultrafiltration during CPB. MUF Set Up : means that we are using an active ultrafiltration setup with the hemoconcentrator outlet connected to the arterial pump boot line. * An active ultrafiltration option is available for all circuits. This option minimizes the obligate shunts in a perfusion circuit which may impact effective forward flow. The Terumo CDI shunt line is typically the only obligate shunt when active ultrafiltration is set up for a circuit. Infant Packs : All cases set up for MUF, regardless of surgeon. Toddler Packs : All cases set up for MUF, regardless of surgeon. Child Packs : • 1/4"" boot cases (generally, BSA <0.7) are set up for MUF, regardless of surgeon. • 3/8"" boot cases are set up for active ultrafiltration only (with option for passive UF) but may be set up for MUF based on surgeon or perfusionist preference. Adult Packs : Traditional passive ultrafiltration set up only. These circuits may include active ultrafiltration with the use of a ""MUF pack"".","Left heart bypass cases typically are performed with a simple circuit involving a centrifugal head as well as outflow and inflow tubing.

Where the permitted expedited categories do not apply, but the IRB has determined and documented at a convened meeting that the research i. Involves no greater than minimal risk a nd ii. No additional risks have been identified. 4. Review will be conducted at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less than once per year. Time Interval Upon initial review of a protocol, the IRB determines the time interval for the next continuing review. Review must occur within 1-year of the last approval date for a protocol to remain active; however, the IRB may decide more frequent review is necessary. 1. Convened IRB : For a protocol reviewed by the convened IRB, continuing review must occur within 1 year of the protocol being approved at a convened IRB meeting. 2. Expedited Review : For a protocol approved under expedited review that still requires Continuing Review, the review must occur within 1 year of the date the IRB Chair or designated IRB member(s) provide initial approval. More Frequent Review More frequent review may be based on a specific time interval or on a requirement to report back after a specified number of participants have been studied. In making the determination that more frequent review is required, the IRB takes into consideration: 1. The risk of the protocol and 2. The type of information the IRB would like to receive in order to assure appropriate oversight on an ongoing basis. Criteria used to consider whether more frequent review is required includes the following : 1. High-risk protocols where there is concern about significant adverse events that may be permanent, irreversible, or disabling, or that may significantly compromise the research subject. 2. Protocols where the potential risks are completely unknown, unless the minutes document that approval is granted for 1 year. 3. Protocols that involve newborns that include conditions for which it is not possible to perform studies in older children. 4. Protocols submitted with data from preliminary studies that raise concern regarding the possibility of serious adverse events. If more frequent review is required, the investigator will be informed through the approval notification and the CHeRP system will be set to notify the investigator at the required time. At the time of continuing review, the convened IRB or expedited reviewer will assure that all criteria for approval of research continue to be met. Review Tracking The IRB administrative office is responsible for tracking continuing reviews and for notifying investigators when review is required. The Continuing Review SmartForm must be submitted and approved prior to the protocol's expiration date. Principal Investigators (PIs) must submit the continuing review with ample time for the IRB to address any needed questions and revisions. 1. Three months before the protocol's expiration, the CHeRP system will send an automated notice to the PI and research team. 2. If the continuing review is not received, then a. A second notice will be sent at 2 months before the expiration date. b. A third notice will be sent 1 month before the expiration date. Continuing Review: Expedited and Convened IRB Review Process Expedited Review Continuing reviews which qualify for expedited review may be reviewed through the expedited review procedures. Convened IRB All continuing reviews which do not qualify for expedited review are placed on the agenda for the convened IRB meeting. The IRB will use the same criteria and take the same actions described in the IRB policy, 1. One IRB reviewer is assigned to each continuing review. 2. No member with a conflict of interest may serve as a reviewer. 3. All members can access the continuing review submission via CHeRP. Through CHeRP, IRB members have electronic access to the complete IRB protocol file and relevant IRB minutes, including amendments/modifications, unanticipated problems, and previous continuing review approvals. 4. The Continuing Review SmartForm includes: a. The number of subjects accrued: i. Enrolled (signed consent form) ii. Withdrawn due to subject request iii. Withdrawn due to toxicity/adverse events iv. Lost to follow-up v. Completed study (without events leading to early termination) vi. Currently active on study vii. Other category b. Removed for ineligibility c. A summary of adverse events and any unanticipated problems that involve risks to subjects or others, and any withdrawal of subjects from the research or complaints about the research since the last IRB review. d. If applicable: i. A summary of any relevant recent literature and interim findings. ii. Data and safety monitoring reports may be submitted. iii. Any relevant multi-center trial reports. iv. Monitoring reports from sponsors. e. Any other relevant information, particularly information about risks associated with the research. f. Links to the currently approved protocol, recruitment documents, and informed consent documents. g. Information regarding reliance arrangements 5. IRB members are provided with a continuing review Reviewer Worksheet to complete. When reviewing the current informed consent document, the IRB ensures that : a. The currently approved or proposed consent document is still accurate and complete; and b. Any significant new findings that may relate to the subject's willingness to continue to participate are provided to the subject. 6. The IRB may request and rely on a current statement from the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) or the sponsor that indicates it has reviewed study-wide adverse events, interim findings, and any recent literature that may be relevant to the research, in lieu of requiring that this information be submitted directly to the IRB. 7. In general, when taking an action of conditional approval at the time of continuing review, any noted conditions need to be satisfied before an investigator may continue research activities related to the conditions specified. a. During the continuing review, the IRB may make determinations that currently enrolled subjects may continue, but no new subjects may be enrolled until a designated IRB member reviews a revised protocol and verifies that conditions are met. 8. After the convened IRB meeting, the investigator is sent notification of the action taken. a. When approved, the informed consent dates are modified to reflect the new period of approval and expiration.","Once a Reportable Event form is received by the IRB, the following actions will occur: 1. The Senior Director of Clinical Research Compliance will screen the submission to determine whether it meets the Criteria of Reporting. 2. The Senior Director will obtain initial feedback from the investigator when there are questions or additional information is required. a. Based on the information received, if there is any immediate concern that subjects already enrolled or subjects to be enrolled in the trial may be subject to immediate increased harm to their health, safety, or welfare, the IRB Chair will be immediately contacted. i. If necessary, the IRB Chair will require that the protocol be suspended or terminated. In most situations this will not be necessary. 3. IRB Chair Review: All submitted reportable events will be reviewed by the IRB Chair or Vice Chair who will determine if the event should be placed before the convened IRB. a. The IRB Chair will review the event and ask for any associated documentation and/or information they feel necessary to understand and review the event. b. The investigator will receive written notification as to whether the report was accepted, whether additional information or action is required or placed before the convened IRB for consideration 4. Convened IRB review: a. Each event will be assigned a primary reviewer. b. At the IRB meeting the reviewer will report on the event to the full committee and determine whether any further action as listed below is required. c. All IRB members will receive a copy of the event form and have access to the entire protocol, approved consent and history through the CHeRP system. d. The IRB will make a final determination as to whether the event needs to be reported as an unanticipated problem involving risks to participants or others. If the IRB determines that the event is an unanticipated problem involving risks to participants or others, the event will be reported. e. The investigator will receive written notification as to whether the report was accepted, if additional information or action is required, and/or reporting is required.","The IRB calculates the date of initial IRB approval in the following manner: 1. Convened IRB Reviewed Study a. When a research study is approved at a convened IRB meeting, the date of the convened IRB meeting is the approval date. b. When the research study is conditionally approved at a convened IRB meeting, the date of the IRB approval remains the date the study was conditionally approved at a convened IRB meeting. The date the designated IRB reviewer determines that the research protocol has satisfied all conditions required, reflected in the CHeRP action ""Research Team Response Adequate"". 2. Expedited Study: When a research study is reviewed and approved through an expedited review process, the date the expedited reviewer approves the research is approval date.","1. The Principal Investigator must promptly notify the IRB. a. For DoD-conducted research, the human protections director must notify the component office of human research protections. b. For DoD-supported research, the non-DoD organization must notify the DoD human research protection official and other federal agencies. 2. DoD organizations must demonstrate to the senior designated official that the IRB has fulfilled its duties in accordance with DHHS Subpart D, 45 CFR 46. 407 and 21 CFR 50.54. 3. If the researcher asserts to the IRB that it is in the best interest of the prisoner-participant to continue to participate in the research while a prisoner, the IRB Chair may determine that the prisoner-participant continue to participate until the convened IRB can review this request to approve a change in the research protocol and until the Organizational Official and DoD Component Office review the IRB's approval to change the research protocol. Otherwise, the IRB chair shall require that all research interactions and interventions with the prisoner-participant (including obtaining identifiable private information) cease until the convened IRB can review the request to approve a change in the research protocol. 4. The convened IRB, upon receipt of notification that a previously enrolled human participant has become a prisoner, shall promptly re-review the research protocol to ensure that the rights and wellbeing of the human subject, now a prisoner, are not in jeopardy. a. The IRB should consult with a subject matter expert having the expertise of a prisoner representative if the IRB reviewing the research protocol does not have a prisoner representative. b. If the prisoner-participant can continue to consent to participate and is capable of meeting the research protocol requirements, the terms of the prisoner-participant's confinement does not inhibit the ethical conduct of the research, and there are no other significant issues preventing the research involving human participants from continuing as approved, the convened IRB may approve a change in the study to allow this prisoner-participant to continue to participate in the research. c. This approval is limited to the individual prisoner-participant and does not allow recruitment of prisoners as participants.",3,1,1,1,2,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

What are the steps for confirming proper placement of a postpyloric feeding tube and when can the tube be used for feeding,1,"• Registered Nurses (RNs) and Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs), who have demonstrated competency in the insertion of post-pyloric feeding tubes, may place these tubes, following the guidelines described in this document. • Recommended sizes: ◦ 6 Fr 22 in non-weighted feeding tube with a stylet for patients ≤ 5kg. ◦ 8 36-43 in Fr non-weighted feeding tube with stylet for patients > 5kg. ◦ Consider use of 10 Fr 43 in feeding tube in patients > 12 years of age. • Obtain a prescriber order for abdominal x-ray (KUB) after feeding tube placement to confirm proper tube position.","To prepare the Patient • Verify the Prescriber Order. • Verify the identity of the patient as described in the Nursing Policy and Procedure: Patient Identification. • Explain procedure to the patient and/or family to promote understanding and cooperation. • Perform hand hygiene and wear protective equipment as described in the Infection Control Manual: Hand Hygiene and Standard Precautions policies. To insert the tube • Examine the stylet/tube for a secure tube/luer fit. • Flush tube through the stylet port with water to ensure easy stylet removal after placement. • Position patient in a comfortable position, recommend elevating head of bed 15-30 degrees as tolerated. • Using the tube, approximate distance to the stomach mark (I) by measuring the distance from the tip of nose to the ear lobe, then down to the xiphoid process. Approximate the duodenal mark (II), by measuring the distance from the xiphoid process to the mid axillary line. Approximate the jejunal mark (III) by adding 5 – 10cm after the duodenal mark. • (5-7cm Newborn-1yr) • (7-10cm 1-4 yrs) • (10cm >4yrs) • Using a permanent marker, make a series of slashes along the tube at the identified measurements. • Lubricate the tip of the tube and then slowly insert tube into the nare. Direct the tube posteriorly parallel to the nasal septum. • If patient experiences any sign of respiratory distress or coughing during insertion, remove the tube. • Continue advancing tube to the first mark (gastric). • After tube is advanced to the first mark, roll patient into extreme right decubitus position as tolerated to facilitate passage of tube from stomach into duodenum. • Advance the tube to the second mark (duodenal) while simultaneously insufflating small volume of air (5-10 mL briskly), a ""subtle"" give may be noted as the feeding tube crosses the pylorus. The tube is then advanced another 5-10 cm (per above guidelines) to third mark to ensure jejunal or distal duodenal placement. • Insufflate 3-5 mL of air into the tube and then pull back on the syringe plunger. Aspiration of less than 1 mL represents a positive ""snap test"", as the plunger often snaps back into the syringe. • If snap test is not positive, gently pull tube back to the first (gastric) mark and repeat steps 13-15 until positive snap is elicited (up to 3 attempts) and then proceed to next step. • Auscultate 2-5 mL of air over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Listen for presence of high- pitched crackles. Auscultate over distal esophagus for absence of sounds. • With one hand holding feeding tube at the nare, gently remove stylet from the tube by withdrawing the stylet with your free hand. Secure tube to face with dressing and tape. Label the tube as ""post-pyloric"" and document exit mark in electronic health record. • Consider maintaining patient in right side-lying position for up to 30 minutes as tolerated to facilitate peristalsis of tube into jejunum. • Obtain KUB to confirm proper placement of post-pyloric tube. • Do not use tube until post-pyloric placement is confirmed by KUB and communicated by prescriber. ◦ Note: Tube does not have to be situated in the jejunum to be considered a successful post-pyloric placement. It needs only be located past the pylorus, preferably between the second part of the duodenum and the ligament of Treitz of jejunum. If true jejunal depth is required, please speak with the fluoroscopy department. • Re-confirmation of tube placement by KUB is necessary if there are any concerns for displacement.","• Obtain a Gastroenterology (GI) consult prior to discharge to establish follow-up, and discuss a plan for replacement of tube when needed. • In general, if oral intake is expected to improve over the first year of life (for example, feeding immaturity related to prematurity or aspiration), nasal tubes may be a viable option for discharge to home, after discussion with the family. ◦ Pros: Avoidance of surgery/laparoscopy, temporary nature of the tube ◦ Cons: Tubes prone to dislodgement, need to maintain tube on the face, nasal congestion/obstruction from the tube • Patients are generally discharged with a post-pyloric tube (versus NG) if they improved with inpatient post-pyloric feedings, and/or continue to have severe illness that prompted the original placement of the post-pyloric tube (e.g. respiratory, neuromuscular, or GER), especially if being transferred to a rehabilitation facility (versus home). • Specific considerations for home post-pyloric feeding that should be discussed amongst the medical team, GI consulting service, and family are: ◦ Replacement of dislodged post-pyloric tubes does not occur at home, in a clinic, or in most locals Emergency Departments. The infant would likely need to present to the BCH ED to replace the tube via fluoroscopy. ◦ Post-pyloric feeds run continuously, over a majority of the hours per day, which may complicate activities, especially in the outpatient setting.","1.

At DFCI, the Clinical Director and Director of Nursing/Patient Services review patient satisfaction Press- Ganey data.","[URAC P-PSC 1-3 (a)] It is Boston Children’s Hospital policy to treat suspected or potential adverse reactions as adverse reactions, therefore the same procedure would be followed for both. A. A standardized reporting mechanism will be employed: 1. All ADEs will be referred to the Specialty Pharmacy Manager for appropriate follow-up; 2. Adverse event reporting will be documented through the hospital’s internal web-based Safety Event Report System (SERS) within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. a. Any hospital employee, volunteer, Medical Staff member, or House Staff member may report an adverse event. b. If staff are uncertain whether an event is a reportable adverse event staff should err on the side of reporting. 3. All clinically significant ADEs will be communicated to the prescribing physician (or attending physician if the prescriber is not available) immediately as well as submit a SERS within 24 hours of becoming aware of the adverse drug event; 4. If the ADE is an ADR, new information (i.e., a new allergy or adverse reaction) must be immediately documented as a coded medication in the patient’s medical record in the allergy/adverse reaction section. B. Criteria for reporting an event through SERS: 1. Events to be submitted through SERS include: a. Any occurrence of an adverse event, any near miss, an event, or situation that places at patient at increased risk of harm, or unplanned significant change in medical or surgical management not related to the patient’s underlying condition b. While the adverse event (and clinically relevant patient information resulting from the event) is documented in the patient’s medical record, the SERS report is maintained separate from the medical report for review purposes. c. Staff should report any unsafe conditions for patients or staff through SERS. C. Completed forms will be routed according to policy and procedure: 1. The Pharmacy Director of Safety & Quality & the Specialty Pharmacy Manager will be notified within 24 hours. D. The responsibility for investigating and responding to events resides with PPSQ (Program for Pharmacy Safety and Quality) but may be delegated to the individual or department reporting the event for events of lower severity and that are not externally reportable. In all cases, the response to an event is dependent upon the nature and severity of the event. E. ADEs are presented and summarized monthly to the Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T) Committee for review and recommendations for action needed. F. The Pharmacy Director of Safety and Quality and the Specialty Pharmacy Manager shall meet quarterly to discuss any ADEs during the quarter or the discussion will take place during quarterly QMC meetings. A detailed analysis shall be compiled which may include a plan of correction and a process for quality improvement. G. On at least a quarterly basis, report aggregate findings, including adverse drug events and errors, to the Quality Management Committee or other quality oversight body responsible for quality management. H. The pharmacy will contact prescribers to inform them of serious (SERS level 3-5) adverse events reported by patients or caregivers. I. Boston Children’s Specialty Pharmacy will report serious and unexpected adverse drug events to appropriate external entities such as Med-Watch and to the drug manufacturer (if contractually obligated). [URAC P-PSC 1-3 (a)] Adverse events are reported externally in accordance with applicable state and federal laws and regulations, and hospital policy. J. All follow-up activities and reports shall be monitored by the Pharmacy Director of Safety and Quality and the Specialty Pharmacy Manager for a period of one (1) year following initiation of the plan of correction.","[URAC P-PSC 1-3 (a)] A. The goals of this policy are: 1. To have a positive impact in improving patient care; 2. To focus attention on understanding the causes that underlie the event; 3. To reduce the probability of a reoccurrence of the event in the future; and 4. To increase the general awareness and enhance strategies for prevention. B. When an adverse event occurs in a health care organization, it is necessary that the appropriate individuals in leadership positions within the organization be made aware of the event; investigate and understand the causes that underlie the event; and make changes in the organization's systems and processes to reduce the probability of such an event in the future. These leaders are responsible for establishing processes for the identification, reporting, analysis, and prevention of adverse events and for ensuring the consistent and ongoing implementation of a root cause analysis. C. Adverse Events that are subject to review by advisory boards and accrediting bodies include: 1. An occurrence or event which results in an unanticipated death; or 2. An event in which major and permanent loss of function (not related to the natural course of the patient's illness or condition) occurs. D. When such an event occurs the Specialty Pharmacy Manager, or their designee, is expected to prepare a thorough and credible root cause analysis and action plan within forty-five (45) calendar days of the event or of becoming aware of the event. The organization may submit the written analysis and plan to its accrediting body at its discretion and as advised by their legal counsel. E. The responsibility for investigating and responding to events resides with Program for Patient Safety and Quality (PPSQ), but may be delegated to the individual or department reporting the event for events of lower severity and that are not externally reportable. In all cases, the response to an event is dependent upon the nature and severity of the event F. Responses to an adverse event may include, but are not limited to: 1. Activation of the Safety Event Rapid Response Team (SERRT) 2. Investigation: Initiation of an investigation and causal analysis of events is undertaken by PPSQ staff and/or local leaders, depending on the nature and severity of the event. The approach seeks to identify system failures that contributed to the adverse event. Techniques employed may include: a. Root Cause Analysis (ACA) i. The RCA (including internal discussions, analysis, and corrective actions related to clinicians) is considered peer review protected information that is approved by the Senior Clinical Leadership Committee (SCLC). b. Apparent Cause Analysis (RCA) i. E.g. Precursor or Near-Miss events c. Clinical practice concerns of an individual clinician (MD or RN) may be referred to the Medical Peer Review or Nursing Peer Review process. Issues identified related to individual trainees will be referred to the appropriate training program director. d. When appropriate, relevant patient outcomes and adverse events may also be reviewed at Divisional or Departmental Morbidity and Mortality (M&M) conferences, consistent with the M&M Policy. G. If applicable, the Specialty Pharmacy Manager will conduct a root cause analysis which includes the following elements: 1. Focuses primarily on systems and processes, not on individual performance; 2. Progresses from special causes in clinical processes to common causes in organizational processes; 3. Repeatedly digs deeper by asking ""why?"" and then ""why?"" again; 4. Identifies changes which could be made in systems and processes that would reduce the risk of such events occurring in the future; and 5. Is thorough and credible. H. Boston Children’s Specialty Pharmacy, as it provides patient/consumer care in the delivery of medications, utilizes the FDA Med-Watch criteria in establishing its definition and reporting requirement of adverse events. [URAC P-PSC 1-3 (a)] 1. The following are reportable adverse events: a. Death - when a medication causes death or contributed to the death of a patient; b. Life-threatening - when a medication may have resulted in the death of a patient if use of the medication had continued; c. Hospitalization - when the medication caused or contributed to the hospitalization of a patient; d. Disability - when a medication may have caused or contributed to a permanent injury or impairment of the patient; e. Intervention - if medical or surgical intervention was necessary to preclude permanent damage due to the use of the medication. I. Adverse events will be reported to a supervisor or other clinical/administrative leader(s) as well as the hospital’s internal web-based Safety Event Reporting System (SERS) within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. The Specialty Pharmacy Manager will be notified when a reportable adverse event occurs, and appropriate action will be taken. The first priority is mitigation of harm to the patient and the appropriate communication with the family.

Boston Children’s Specialty Pharmacy provides relevant information and guidance on plain language to staff that write or review consumer marketing materials to ensure they produce materials that are clear and easily understood by the intended audience. a. Plain Language Guidelines to follow that aid in Health Literacy: [URAC CPE 4-2 (a, b)] i. Write for your audience a. Use language your audience knows and feels comfortable with. Take your audience’s current level of knowledge into account. Do not write for an 8th grade class if your audience is providers. ii. Organize a. Organization is key. Start by stating the document’s purpose and its bottom line. b. Eliminate filler and unnecessary content. Put the most important information at the beginning and include background information (when necessary) toward the end iii. Use chronological organization a. Limit levels to three or fewer b. Address separate audiences separately c. Address one person, not a group d. Use lots of useful headings e. Write short sections iv. Write your document a. With a relatively small amount of effort and in a relatively short amount of time, you can significantly improve traditionally-written material. b. Words i. Words matter. They are the most basic building blocks of written and spoken communication. Choose your words carefully – be precise and concise. c. Verbs i. Verbs tell your audience what to do . Make sure they know who does what. ii. Use active voice a. Active voice makes it clear who is supposed to do what. It eliminates ambiguity about responsibilities. Not “It must be done., but “You must do it.” Passive voice obscures who is responsible for what and is one of the biggest problems with government documents. Do not confuse passive voice with past tense. iii. Use the simplest form of a verb d. Nouns and pronouns i. Nouns add substance and direction. Pronouns engage your audience. ii. Do not complicate things by using words they will not understand or abbreviations that confuse them. a. Minimize abbreviations e. Sentences i. Choose your words carefully. Start with your main idea – do not start with an exception. Word order does matter, so place your words carefully. Keep it short; it is not a crime to use lots of periods. i. Write short sentences f. Paragraphs i. Have a topic sentence ii. Write short paragraphs g. Design your document for easy reading b. Full guidelines can be found at www.plainlanguage.gov 3. Boston Children’s Specialty Pharmacy also ensures that all consumer print communication and educational materials are written at reading levels appropriate to the intended audience. The general target ranges are 5 th to 8 th grade reading levels for consumers, up to 12 th grade reading levels for general public, and college level for communication regarding provider, clinical and contractual issues. The Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease tool is used as a guide to help determine reading ease ( https://readability-score.com/ or Word). Additionally, focus groups that are inclusive of consumers may periodically review materials, as needed, to assess the use of plain language and validate reading ease and understanding. B.

What personal protective equipment PPE is required for nurses when performing suctioning of an artificial airway as outlined in the hospital policy,1,"1. Explain the procedure to the patient and family. 2. Determine if a second person is needed to assist with the suctioning procedure. Patients described in the High Risk Suctioning Procedure and all patients in the CVICU are suctioned by two people, a combination of nursing, respiratory therapist, NP and/or physician. 3. Perform hand hygiene and don PPE as described in the Infection Control manual: Hand Hygiene and Standard Precautions policies. 4. Pre-oxygenate prior to suctioning when indicated. 5. Confirm the level of suction is appropriate for the age of the patient. Suction with vacuum pressure not to exceed -80 mm Hg for neonates, -80 to -100 mm Hg for pediatric patients and -120 mmHg for adult patients. 6. Open suction catheter, don gloves sterile for ICU patients or clean for non-ICU patients. Keep one gloved hand sterile or clean and remove the suction catheter from the package. 7. Connect the suction tubing to the catheter with the non-procedural hand. 8. Suction to a depth no more than 1 cm beyond the end of the artificial airway to prevent irritation/trauma to the trachea and carina, unless a different depth of suction is specified by the prescriber in a written order. a. NICU patients have a depth of suction card posted at the bedside. b. The depth of suction for patients with a tracheostomy tube is found on the Trach Tube Profile Sheet and the Tracheostomy Assessment section of Power Chart. 9. Apply suction while withdrawing the suction catheter. Each pass should not exceed 5 to 10 seconds to decrease the potential for oxygen depletion. Suction can be applied while inserting the suction catheter if secretions are visible. 10. Monitor the patient's vital signs. 11. Consider instillation of 0.5 to 1 ml of sterile NS directly into the artificial airway when thick secretions are present and for small diameter airways (e.g. < 4.0 mm). Practice should be done sparingly, when indicated and tolerated. 12. Repeat the procedure as needed, allowing time to recover between passes of the catheter. 13. Provide post-procedure hyper-oxygenation when indicated. 14. If the instillation of Lidocaine is indicated, follow the above instillation procedure and wait 1-2 minutes for effect.","The personal protective equipment (PPE) policy implements the PPE requirements under OSHA regulations 29 CFR 1910.132 – 29 CFR 1910.140. This policy applies to all individuals on Boston Children's Hospital Main Campus and satellite locations that come in contact with hazardous and/or toxic substances (i.e. physical, chemical, biological, radiological) in the workplace, such as laboratory, clinical, food service, environmental service, and engineering personnel. The Environmental Health and Safety Department (EH&S) provides information and training to employees and contractors on appropriate protective equipment from hazardous and/or toxic substances. The use of PPE alone should not be relied on to provide protection against hazards. Engineering and administrative controls shall be used in place of PPE whenever possible to eliminate or reduce hazards. If potential hazards still exist after all feasible engineering and administrative controls are in place, PPE shall be used in conjunction with engineering and administrative controls to protect employees.","OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.132 requires that a hazard assessment for personal protective equipment (PPE) be conducted before assignment. The purpose of a hazard assessment is to determine whether hazards are present or likely to be present in the workplace which would require the use of PPE. If such hazards are present, or are likely to be present, BCH shall: • Select the appropriate type of PPE that will protect employees from the hazards identified. • Communicate PPE selection decisions to each affected employee. • Provide PPE that properly fits each affected employee. • Conduct and document appropriate employee training in the use and limitations of the equipment provided. BCH department managers/supervisors are responsible for conducting Hazard Assessments in their designated areas with assistance provided by the EH&S department when needed. Each of the basic hazards will be reviewed and a determination made as to the type, level of risk, and seriousness of potential injury. Consideration will be given to the possibility of exposure to several hazards at once. The general procedure for determining appropriate protective equipment is to: • Identify the potential hazards and the type of protective equipment that is available, and what protection it provides (i.e., splash protection, impact protection, etc.) • Compare the capabilities and limitations of various types of PPE with the hazards associated with the environment (e.g., sharp or rough materials, vibration, projectiles, radiation intensities) • Select the PPE which provides a level of protection greater than the minimum required to protect employees from the hazards • Select PPE that will fit each employee properly and provides protection from the hazard","• Suctioning an artificial airway entails the removal of secretions by use of a catheter and regulated wall vacuum. It is indicated in patients with pulmonary secretions, ensures the patency of the airway and is employed routinely and urgently. In-line suctioning potentially reduces cross contamination between patient and caregiver.","All contractors performing work at BCH are required to have implemented OSHA-compliant personal protective equipment programs, and to follow all of BCH's location-specific PPE requirements while on site. Contractors are required to supply any personal protective equipment necessary for jobs performed at BCH.

What are the steps involved in bypassing ultrafiltration of bank blood before a blood transfusion,1,"• Bank blood is known to have nonphysiologic values for many electrolytes which can lead to an undesirable effect on hemodynamics once transfused (1-4). Cell saver washing of PRBC units has been shown to effectively control mediators of hemodynamic change seen with stored blood (2,5). Though, increased cell wall fragility and hemolysis after processing and during bypass may be seen (5,6). This can lead to excess free iron in the blood which has been associated with negative outcomes (7-12). Ultrafiltration of blood prior to transfusion can be used to correct known issues with bank blood. • The method below provides the perfusionist one option for correcting issues with bank blood before transfusion to the pump circuit (13-15). This is done using the blood bag as the reservoir, a blood spike pin, an additional stopcock, and the cell saver circuit blood line. In short, after transferring heparinized plasmalyte to the blood bag, the filtered blood from the bag is directed to the MUF circuit by way of a line from the stopcock of the quick prime line and returned to the blood bag by way of the (MUF) return line to a dispensing pin in the other port of the blood bag.","• The use of blood products in the extracorporeal circuit is dictated by patient need, physician consultation and policy guidelines. • The use of other blood products, such as plasma and platelets (rarely) in the bypass circuit is dictated by the attending surgeon and/or anesthesiologist. • Refer to guidelines Bypass Prime Selection (2.6), Priming the Perfusion Circuit (2.7) and Cell Saver Washing of Blood for Bypass Primes (2.14) for additional information. • Conventional and zero balance ultrafiltration must be considered when administering bank blood and to control the electrolytes and lactate level in the patient's circulating blood volume. • All blood products are irradiated (PRBCs are also leukoreduced) before they are sent to the CVOR. This is an important consideration in the prevention of graft versus host disease and significant morbidity or even mortality.

What are the criteria for making a finding of Research Misconduct according to the hospitals policy,0,"In order to make a finding of Research Misconduct, the Allegation must fit the definition of Research Misconduct, must be a significant departure from accepted practices of the research community, and must be proven by a preponderance of evidence. The Investigation report should specify whether Falsification, Fabrication, or Plagiarism occurred; who committed it, and whether it was intentional, knowing, or in reckless disregard of the truth. The report may also include recommendations for administrative actions or other appropriate sanctions. The draft report will be shared with Respondent (and Complainant if appropriate) to review; their written responses will be considered and addressed by the panel and attached to the final Investigation report.","Allegation An Allegation is a disclosure of possible Research Misconduct by any means of communication. The disclosure may be written or oral. Complainant A person (s) who makes a good faith Allegation of Research Misconduct. Inquiry Preliminary information gathering and fact-finding to determine whether an Allegation warrants an Investigation . Investigation Formal development of a factual record and the examination of that record leading to a decision not to make a finding of Research Misconduct or to a recommendation for a finding of Research Misconduct, which may include a recommendation for other appropriate actions. Preliminary Initial review to determine if the Allegation meets the definition of Research Assessment Misconduct and there is sufficient information to proceed with an Inquiry . Research Fabrication, Falsification, or Plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing Misconduct research, or in reporting research results. Fabrication is making up data or results and recording or reporting them. Falsification is manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record. Plagiarism is the appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit. Research Misconduct does not include honest error or differences of opinion. Respondent The person(s) against whom an Allegation of Research Misconduct is directed, or who is the subject of a Research Misconduct proceeding.","BCH is committed to fostering a research environment that promotes responsible research practices in compliance with regulatory and institutional requirements, and to helping prevent Research Misconduct. Covered individuals have an obligation to report allegations of research misconduct and to provide evidence to the RIO. Allegations should be specific. Individuals should not discuss the allegation(s) with others prior to discussion with the RIO. BCH will respond to each Allegation in a thorough, competent, objective, and fair manner, and will take reasonable steps to conduct an impartial and unbiased Research Misconduct proceeding. Individuals are required to inform the RIO immediately of any attempted violation of procedural integrity, or any breach of confidentiality or privacy. The RIO will address any concerns regarding personal, professional, of financial conflict of interest among individuals involved in the proceeding. A. Non-Retaliation Through the RIO, BCH will take all reasonable and practical steps to protect good faith Complainants , witnesses, and panel members, their positions and reputations, and counter potential or actual retaliation against them. B. Confidentiality and Privacy To the extent feasible, all individuals involved in a Research Misconduct proceeding shall make diligent efforts to limit disclosure of information only to those who have a need to know, in order to minimize damage to the reputation of individuals, protect the confidentiality of the Respondent and Complainant, and of research records or evidence from which research subjects might be identified. The RIO can, at his/her discretion, communicate any aspect of the matter covered by this Policy with other agencies, departments, and offices whose jurisdiction or interests are implicated by the alleged misconduct and take necessary actions to protect the scientific integrity of the project. C. Cooperation Individuals involved in a Research Misconduct proceeding are expected to fully participate and cooperate in good faith. Obstruction of any aspect of the proceeding may itself constitute evidence of Research Misconduct. Obstruction includes intentionally withholding or destroying evidence in violation of a duty to disclose or preserve; falsifying evidence; encouraging, soliciting, or giving false testimony; and attempting to intimidate witnesses, potential witnesses, or potential leads to witnesses or evidence. D. Coordination with Other Academic Institutions Harvard Medical School (""HMS"")- If the Respondent had an appointment as fellow or faculty at HMS at the time of the alleged Research Misconduct, the RIO shall confer and discuss the logistics of joint review with HMS. The RIO, following consultation with the Compliance Department, may choose to delegate any or all of the functions described in the Policy to HMS, for resolution according to the ""Principles and Procedures for Dealing with Allegations of Faculty Misconduct."" The decision of whether to delegate and what policy is applicable shall be made in accordance with the following criteria and conditions: a. Substantial involvement of full-time Harvard faculty or fellow as co-investigators in a research project; b. Substantial involvement of investigators from Harvard-affiliated hospitals other than the BCH in a research project; c. Substantial involvement of Harvard students in a research project; d. Involvement of BCH medical staff so senior as to call into question ability of BCH-specific processes to be fair and neutral; and e. Funding by HMS or HMS is the primary site receiving sponsored funds. BCH shall retain jurisdiction over part or all proceedings and apply this Policy when the following conditions are present: a. All significant witnesses and all Respondents are employees of or otherwise directly affiliated with BCH; b. BCH personnel have subject matter expertise and availability to undertake fact-finding in regard to the subject matter of the Allegations; c. When other institutions' personnel are involved, the other institutions' RIOs express a preference for BCH' s process as opposed to HMS' s process and agree to full cooperation with the BCH process; and d. Funding by BCH for the research or BCH is the primary site receiving funds. Howard Hughes Medical Institute (""HHMI"")- If the Respondent is an employee of HHMI at the time of the alleged Research Misconduct, RIOs will jointly decide whether BCH will apply this Policy or whether the HMS or HHMI Policy on Research Misconduct will apply. Other Institutions- If the Respondent is an employee at other non-Harvard-affiliated institution at the time of the alleged Research Misconduct, the RIO shall coordinate further review with the other institution. RIOs at impacted institutions jointly determine which institution will bear primary responsibility. BCH is committed to sharing of information and keeping other institutions informed as to the proceedings, where the interest of both BCH and other institutions are significantly impacted.","The RIO may dismiss an Allegation brought more than six (6) years after the alleged Research Misconduct occurred, unless (1) the Respondent continues or renews any incident through citation, re-publication, or other use of the research record that is alleged to have been Fabricated, Falsified, or Plagiarized; or (2) the alleged Research Misconduct, would possibly have a substantial adverse effect on the health or safety of the public. BCH shall retain all records related to Research Misconduct proceeding for seven (7) years after completion of the institutional or PHS-related proceeding, whichever is later. This includes documentation of rationale for excluded documents that were deemed irrelevant or duplicate. At the end of the seven years, records are subject to the BCH Record Retention Policy.","1.

Click on the protocol title to access the protocol main page","Due to the increasing numbers of non-English speaking patients, Interpreter Services have contracted with remote interpreters to help as needed. This process is facilitated using iPads dedicated for this purpose. 1. It is always preferred to have an interpreter present during a research informed consent process; however, Interpreter Services will triage some requests for the use of remote services. 2. This decision depends on availability of in-house interpreters and the specific language requested. 3. If a short form is approved by the IRB and the Remote Interpreter (VRI iPad Technology) is utilized, there are regulatory requirements that must be followed to assure compliance. 4. The IRB has a required checklist that should be completed and filed with the research record when a remote interpreter is utilized. See IRB Checklist: Use of Remote Interpreters & VRI iPad Technology for Short Form Consent Method 5. When interpreters are present in the room and a short form is used, they can sign the English consent and short forms as a witness. However, when the interpreter is remote, wet signatures on the consent forms are not possible and the following extra steps are required. Short Form with Remote Interpreter: Process 1. Research team member: Call the remote interpreter using the VRI iPad or by phone to start the consent process. a. Use the English consent (long form) as a guide for discussion. 2. Before the consent process begins, the research team member needs to state the following: ""Because you are not here and unable to sign documents we need to ask if you will allow us to sign on your behalf by writing your name and ID# on the consent forms in a section that says witness. We want to let you know that the term witness has a very limited definition when used for this purpose. It means: a. you were present by phone or live video during the consent process; b. the information was presented in the language you were told was c. understood by the subject/parent/guardian; and d. the subject/family was given the opportunity to ask questions while you were present. The consent form includes this definition. Will you agree and allow me to sign on your behalf by writing your name and ID# on the consent forms?"" Yes/No. a. If NO , the research team member may want to ask what the concern is and try to resolve it. i. If they do not agree, you should not enroll the subject until you can find another interpreter who is able to serve this role. b. If YES , proceed. i. Conduct the consent process with the VRI iPad interpreter using the English consent as a guide for content during the discussion. 3. After the consent discussion, with the remote interpreter present the research team member obtaining the consent, must ask the remote interpreter to ask the subject/family/guardian the following two questions: a. Did you understand the information about the research? Yes/No i. If YES , continue to next question. ii. If NO , the consent process must continue until a yes response is received. b. Do you have any questions? Yes/No i. If YES , all questions must be answered before moving on ii. If NO , continue to obtain signatures. Short Form with Remote Interpreter: Documentation Requirements 1. Subject/parent/guardian signs, dates and specifies the relationship to child on short form. 2. The person obtaining consent (PI/Coordinator), signs the English consent form (""long form""). 3. The person obtaining consent (PI/Coordinator) records the Interpreter name and ID# on both short and the English Consent (long) form and writes ""As authorized by [insert interpreter's name]"" on: a. The witness signature line on the short form. b. The witness signature line on the English consent. 4. Assent, IF REQUIRED : the research team member must indicate one of the following: a. Minor subject signs and dates the short form Reason assent was not obtained 5. Provide the subject/parent/guardian: a. A copy of the signed and dated short form document and b. A copy of the signed and dated English consent (long form). 6. File together the: a. Signed English consent (long form) b. Signed short form and c.

Keep a record of all updates, changes and discussions with the subject/parent/guardian. b. All pertinent notes, concerns and questions should be documented, even after the consent form has been signed.","Maintain precautions as indicated in the table below when transporting a patient to other areas. Inform the area receiving the patient in advance regarding the need for precautions. When transporting a patient on precautions within the healthcare facility, the appropriate use of barriers to prevent spread of the infectious agent is based upon the mode of transmission and the patient's circumstances (e.g., age, mental status, etc.). For example, because it may be difficult for an infant to wear a mask, the transporter may need to wear a face mask and make arrangements to avoid other patients, staff and visitors in route (such as using an empty elevator).

What factors does the Department of Children and Families DCF consider when making a determination about providing psychiatric treatment or administering Psychotropic medications to a child under their care and protection,0,"• Forcibly medicating a patient is not permitted unless an emergency situation exists where failure to medicate will result in a substantial likelihood of physical harm to that patient or others. Before medication is provided to a patient without voluntary and knowledgeable consent, consult the BCH Attorney on Call. ◦ If the Department of Children and Families (DCF) is involved with the child under a care and protection, they will make a determination whether care is routine or extraordinary (providing psychiatric treatment or administering Psychotropic medications), considering the complexity, risk and novelty of the proposed care; possible side effects; the intrusiveness of the proposed care; the clarity of the medical opinion on the need for the proposed care; the extent of conflicting interests between the decision-makers and what is in the best interests of the child; and the extent of prior judicial involvement in healthcare decision-making on behalf of the child. • Facts supporting the psychiatrist's judgment that an emergency exists should be documented in the patient's medical record. In a non-emergency, consent must be obtained in a manner pursuant to these guidelines (i.e., appropriate consent from patient, parent, or legal guardian).","1. If a child is in DCF custody and DCF has responsibility for medical decision making, then DCF must provide informed consent for all medications, except for the use of anti-psychotic medication. If anti- psychotic medications are indicated for a patient in DCF custody, then DCF needs to seek prior judicial approval. 2. If a child is in the Department's care because of a voluntary placement including a CRA (Child Requiring Assistance) application, the consent decision remains with the parents.","• A patient under the age of 18 is considered a minor under Massachusetts law and the following individuals may consent to treatment on behalf of a minor: ◦ Parents with legal custody of a minor; ◦ Court appointed legal guardian (guardian), which is defined as the following: ▪ A biological or adoptive parent who has not had their parental rights taken away by a court order; ▪ A court appointed individual with authority to make some or all decisions for a person (need to ensure that the decision-making includes medical) without the capacity to consent; or ▪ An individual with a valid court order proving that individual's designation as a legal guardian as well as a description of the scope of the legal decision-making authority (including decisions regarding medical care and treatment) contemplated by the guardianship. ◦ Duly authorized delegates named by the legal guardian of a minor, evidenced by a properly executed Delegation of Authority or a Massachusetts Caregiver Affidavit; or ◦ A state agency (e.g., Department of Children and Families (DCF), Department of youth Services (DYS), or Department of Mental Health (DMH)) with custody of a child under a ""care and protection"". ▪ The agency or its delegate (e.g., a foster parent) with custody under a care and protection is the only party who can provide consent unless the proposed care is considered ""extraordinary,"" in which case a court would need to issue an order authorizing the extraordinary care and treatment. ▪ If the state agency is only involved generally with coordinating services through a ""care requiring assistance"" arrangement, then the parent of the patient continues to have legal authority for consent. ▪ The Department of Children and Families (DCF) may delegate to foster parents the right to authorize routine medical and dental care, emergency care, or specific services (surgical or other) to children placed in their home. Written authorization to consent should be presented in the form of either a Foster Parent Authorization Card or a Child-Specific Foster Parent Agreement. ▪ Special services such as psychiatric services may be provided if the DCF social worker has listed these services on the Child Specific Agreement Form . Note, in an emergency, the patient should be treated whether or not consent has been obtained ◦ A minor is considered ""Emancipated"" to be able to make their own decisions if they have obtained a court order to end the rights and responsibilities of the parents. It is important to note that the court order can grant either : (1) a ""Partial Emancipation"" to allow the minor to make decisions about themselves, but still be entitled to financial support from the parents (most common); or (2) ""Complete Emancipation"" to allow minor to make any decision about themselves (NOT common). ◦ Regardless of emancipation, a minor may also be determined to be a ""mature minor"" who can consent to their own health care without parental involvement or consent, only under the following circumstances: ▪ Married, widowed, or divorced; ▪ Pregnant or believes herself to be pregnant; ▪ A parent of a child (he/she may also give consent for the medical/dental care of the child); ▪ Enlisted in the military on a full-time active duty basis; ▪ Living separate and apart from parents or a legal guardian and is managing their own financial affairs; ▪ Reasonably believes they have contracted a disease dangerous to the public health, and they seek treatment for such disease; ▪ Seeking their own treatment for: drug addiction (provided that they are at least 12 years old and two or more physicians determined the child is drug dependent), family planning services, or treatment for sexually transmitted diseases (including HIV or AIDS); or ▪ Seeking to voluntarily commit themselves for mental health treatment without parental consent (provided they are at least 16 years of age). Note: Consents by a mature minor are confidential. Parent/guardians should not be informed about the procedure unless: (1) the provider reasonably believes that the minor's condition is dangerous to life or limb; or (2) the minor agrees. Such agreements must be documented in the patient's medical record. If the mature minor's parent and/or guardian is not notified, make sure that the finance office is also notified, so confidentiality is maintained and special payment arrangements are put into place if necessary.","For children residing in Massachusetts, there are two methods by which the Department of Children and Families (DCF) may be involved with a family. Only the first method (outlined below) will impact the process for obtaining consent to enroll into a research study (as documented in state regulations 110 CMR 11.23, and state policy (DCF Policy #91-005, revised 07/08/2008)): 1. The first method is a Care and Protection (C&P), where DCF has obtained legal custody through a permanent or temporary order and must provide the consent for enrollment in a research study. This includes the following considerations: a. If the child is still residing with the parents or with family members, the study must obtain consent from the DCF social worker managing the case. The DCF social worker has authority through state regulations as the legally authorized representative of DCF to consent for care and treatment as well as enroll in a research study. b. If the child is in foster care, the study must also obtain consent from the DCF social worker managing the case, who is the legally authorized representative on behalf of DCF. Please note that foster parents cannot provide consent unless they have a specific delegation of authority from DCF (which is rarely provided). Researcher should also be aware that if DCF has started the court process for removal of parental rights, then DCF will seek court approval prior to allowing the child to be enrolled that may delay obtaining consent to participate. 2. The second method that DCF may be involved with a family is a Child Requiring Assistance (CRA), where DCF is providing general assistance to a family to assist with the care needs of the child. a. In a CRA, parents retain legal custody and only they can provide the consent for medical decisions and/or enrollment into a research study. b. The research study does NOT need to obtain an additional consent from DCF. 3. If there is a question as to how DCF is involved with a family for the purposes of obtaining consent to enroll in a study, please contact the Boston Children's Hospital Office of General Counsel to review any paperwork regarding DCF involvement. For children residing in another state who are in state custody of that respective state, the research study can also contact the Boston Children's Hospital Office of General Counsel if assistance is needed to review any applicable paperwork from the state agency to determine who can provide consent for enrolling into a research study.","The working (or treatment) relationship between families with restrictive eating disorders and health care providers is fundamental in providing excellent health care to children and adolescents. As such, Children's Hospital Boston clinicians are expected to demonstrate a commitment to family-centered care, including demonstrating respect and compassion to all patients and families, acting with honesty and integrity in all professional matters, and working collaboratively and cooperatively with patients and their families to provide optimal patient care. Clinicians are expected to demonstrate a commitment to interpersonal skills and communication, as evidenced by being able to listen, understand, elicit and provide information and patient care effectively to families with the aim of high-quality patient care. Successful adaptation requires patients and their family to develop a good understanding of the illness and recognize its potential complications and treatment. Food avoidance and the accompanying emotional and physical difficulties are fundamental components of all restrictive eating disorders. Successful recovery requires the clinicians, patient, and family to partner and work together. Mental health needs become the focus of treatment following stabilization of acute nutritional and physical status. Adherence to the treatment program is critical. Parents may have fears about survival, a poor outcome, and alteration of life style, which may be manifested as anxiety, guilt, depression, or anger. Because of their own inability to cure their child and the necessary reliance on professional help, parents are obliged to surrender certain degrees of control and may need to forsake their traditional roles. They can become preoccupied with medical details, while psychosocial factors are ignored, considered a lower priority, or deemed irrelevant. Family responses may vary from sharing control with clinicians, to entrusting clinicians without reservations, to entitlement (can neither cede nor share control).",4,3,3,3,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1

What is the expected timeframe for completing nonurgent consults and under what circumstances can this timeframe be adjusted,0,"• A post-anesthesia evaluation must be completed and documented no later than 48 hours after surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia services. The calculation of the 48-hour timeframe begins at the point the patient is moved into the designated recovery area. The evaluation must be completed and documented by any practitioner who is qualified to administer anesthesia as noted in this section of the policy. • The evaluation may not begin until the patient is sufficiently recovered from the acute administration of the anesthesia so as to participate in the evaluation, (e.g., answer questions appropriately, perform simple tasks, etc.) The evaluation can occur in the PACU/ICU or other designated recovery location. • For those patients who are unable to participate in the post-anesthesia evaluation (e.g., postoperative sedation, mechanical ventilation, etc.), a post-anesthesia evaluation should be completed and documented within 48 hours with notation that the patient was unable to participate. This documentation should include the reason for the patient's inability to participate as well as expectations for recovery time, if applicable. • For those patients who require long-acting regional anesthesia to ensure optimum medical care of the patient, whose acute effects will last beyond the 48-hour timeframe, a post-anesthesia evaluation must still be completed and documented within 48 hours. However, there should be a notation that the patient is otherwise able to participate in the evaluation, but full recovery from regional anesthesia has not occurred and is not expected within the stipulated timeframe for the completion of the evaluation. • The elements of an adequate post-anesthesia evaluation should be clearly documented and conform to current standards of anesthesia care, including: ◦ Respiratory function, including respiratory rate, airway patency, and oxygen saturation; ◦ Cardiovascular function, including pulse rate and blood pressure; ◦ Mental status; ◦ Temperature; ◦ Pain; ◦ Nausea and vomiting; and ◦ Post-operative hydration. ◦ Depending on the specific surgery or procedure performed, additional types of monitoring and assessment may be necessary.","• If the employee is selected for the new position, Human Resources will extend a job offer and provide a written offer letter to the employee. • The salary offered for the new role is based on BCH pay policies and guidelines. • Compensation for transfers are established using a method comparable to that used for external candidates to ensure equitable salaries for BCH employees • Once a job offer is made, the employee is expected to notify their current Supervisor/Manager and Recruiter of their decision. • The employee's transfer date to the new position should be mutually agreed upon by the employee's current manager and hiring manager, and will be at least 2 weeks but no more than 4 weeks from when the offer is accepted. On occasion, this timeframe may vary depending upon the needs of the current or hiring manager and if mutually agreed upon by these managers, as well as the employee. Human Resources will work with management to agree upon the transfer date as necessary.","The purpose of the Disaster Recovery Policy is to ensure that Boston Children's Hospital's (BCH) computer system's operations can continue during and after a catastrophic failure or event.

What are the species covered for antibody production according to the hospital policy,0,"ARCH: Animal Resources at Children's Hospital AWAR: Animal Welfare Act Regulations IACUC: Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee USDA: United States Department of Agriculture USDA-covered species : Any species covered by the Animal Welfare Act Regulations (AWAR), i.e., ""dog, cat, nonhuman primate, guinea pig, hamster, rabbit, or any other warm-blooded animal, which is being used, or is intended for research, teaching, testing, experimentation…."" Specifically excluded from the AWAR are ""birds, rats of the genus Rattus and mice of the genus Mus bred for use in research."" By definition this also excludes cold-blooded animals such as fish and frogs. Classification of Procedures 1. Procedure : Any manipulation of an animal for an experimental application, for examination purposes or for the treatment of an induced or spontaneous disease or condition. To differentiate from ""surgical procedures"", ""procedures"" include injection, bandaging or casting, radiography, imaging (MRI, PET, etc.), non-invasive monitoring, antibody production, phlebotomy, euthanasia, etc. Procedures may or may not require the use of a sedative or anesthetic. 2. Surgery : Usually involves an incision and exposure of a tissue for an operative method or the operative manipulation of physiologic or physical parameters to create a model of a clinical disease process or condition and/or the treatment of such disease or condition. Surgery usually requires anesthesia and is further classified as major or minor, survival or acute (non-survival). Survival surgery involving USDA- covered species must be performed in ARCH, and cannot be performed in research laboratories, or by off -site contract or collaborating facilities, unless an exception to this policy is specifically granted by the IACUC. 3. Survival Surgery : Animal recovers, for any length of time, from anesthesia used in a surgical procedure. 4. Acute Surgery : A non-survival surgical procedure in which euthanasia is performed prior to recovery from anesthesia. 5. Major Surgery : Any surgical intervention that penetrates and exposes a body cavity or any procedure which produces permanent impairment of physical or physiological functions. Examples of major surgery include (but are not limited to): a. surgical invasion of a body cavity b. injury and/or repair of tendon/ligament c. amputation of a limb d. enucleation e. orthopedic procedures involving surgical approach f. nephrectomy or nephrotomy 6. Minor Surgery : Any surgical intervention that does not ordinarily have the potential to result in impairment of a vital physical or physiological function. Examples of minor surgery include (but are not limited to): a. percutaneous or cutdown approach to artery or vein b. vessel catheterization c. tissue biopsy not involving surgical exposure of a body cavity d. skin or subcutaneous implants e. surgical repair of superficial injury","Species Covered: Mice, Rabbits, Rats 1. Monoclonal Antibodies a. The production of monoclonal antibodies by hybridoma technology or by the creation of ascites in rodents is frequently used in the animal research setting. b. There is evidence that the mouse ascites method of monoclonal antibody production causes discomfort, distress, or pain. Practical in vitro methods exist which can replace the ascites method in many experimental applications without compromising the aims of the study. c. Accordingly, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs) are expected to critically evaluate the proposed use of the mouse ascites method. d. Prior to approval of proposals which include the mouse ascites method, the IACUC must determine that i. the proposed use is scientifically justified, ii. methods that avoid or minimize discomfort, distress and pain (including in vitro methods) have been considered, and iii. in vitro methods have been found unsuitable. Fulfillment of this three-part IACUC responsibility, with appropriate documentation, is considered central to an institution's compliance with its Animal Welfare Assurance and the Public Health Service (PHS) Policy. e. The federal mandate to avoid or minimize discomfort, pain and distress in experimental animals, consistent with sound scientific practices, is, for all practical purposes, synonymous with a requirement to consider alternative methods that reduce, refine, or replace the use of animals. Consideration of these issues should be incorporated into IACUC review, investigator training, research proposals, and ongoing monitoring of the institutional animal care and use program. IACUCs are expected to implement and routinely evaluate these aspects of the institutional care and use program to ensure compliance with PHS Policy. f. Large amounts of monoclonal antibody can be generated in ascites fluid in the mouse and, occasionally, in the rat model as well. It is the primary responsibility of the investigator to ensure that the health of these animals are maintained throughout the study and that appropriate steps be taken to minimize any pain or distress the animal may undergo. g. Death is not an acceptable experimental endpoint. 2. Polyclonal Antibodies a. The production of antibodies in laboratory animals is considered to be an essential part of research. The goal is to obtain high titers of antisera that, at the same time, does not cause the animal more than momentary discomfort. Polyclonal antibody production is not considered to be painful/distressful to animals under normal conditions. Proper technique and monitoring must be an inherent part of this procedure in order to assure the animal's welfare. 3. Antibody/Ascites Production Services a. Due to space restrictions within ARCH, it is strongly recommended that investigators seek outside contract services for the production of antibodies or ascites. However, this work may only be performed at approved vendors. (Refer to ARCH website for the list of approved vendors.) b. A Boston Children's animal protocol may be required for work performed via a contract service","1. All eligible transplant candidates should be vaccinated against hepatitis B virus infection. Each candidate will be evaluated for proof of Hepatitis B vaccination by review of the immunization record or a positive Hepatitis B Surface antibody during the medical evaluation. If the candidate has not received the vaccine or has a negative antibody result and is not eligible to receive the vaccine, the reason must be documented in the medical record and then reported to the OPTN (once available in OPTN). 2. At the time of the organ offer, but before transplant, the transplant physician or surgeon discusses the donor risks for infection with the intended transplant recipient/guardian. 3. The physician or surgeon obtains approval for ""risk for infection"" donor organs from the patient/guardian during the informed consent process and this is documented in the electronic medical record. The patient/ guardian is notified by the physician or surgeon that both pre and post transplant testing will be completed as described in the table below. a. Exceptions to the notification requirement may be made for extra vessels when, in the medical judgement of the transplanting physician, the extra vessels are required for use in an emergency transplant procedure for an organ other than the organ with which they were recovered. In this case, the transplant hospital must do both of the following post-transplant: i. Inform the recipient of the use of the extra vessels and the ""risk for infection"" status ii. Provide follow up to the recipient as detailed in the chart below (Testing Requirements) 4. The intended recipient has the right to refuse the ""risk for infection"" organ at any time prior to transplant 5. All intended recipients, regardless of donor risk criteria, are tested during the transplant admission, but prior to transplant and at the minimal interval listed in the table below after transplant. After results have been obtained, the physician or nurse notifies the transplant recipient/guardian of the results. If a transplant recipient has known HIV, HBV or HCV then retesting for known infection is not necessary. Results are documented in the electronic medical record. a. All transplant candidates who are less than 12 years of age are not required to receive HIV, HBV, and HCV (details of which specific tests are in the table below) testing during the hospital admission for transplant. i. Those candidates who are less than 12 years of age must still be tested for HIV using a CDC recommended laboratory HIV testing algorithm, Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis B core antibody, Hepatitis B surface antibody, Hepatitis antibody and Hepatitis ribonucleic acid (RNA) by nucleic acid test (NAT) any time prior to transplant and the testing must be documented. 6. If a result is positive, treatment of or prophylaxis for the transmissible disease will be offered/given to the transplant recipient. 7. When a transplant recipient is suspected to have, is confirmed positive for, or has died from a potential transmissible disease or medical condition, including infections and malignancies, and there is substantial concern that it could be from the transplanted organ, the transplant program will do both of the following: a. Notify the institution that recovered the organ (OPO or living donor recovery hospital), without waiting for all medical documentation that may eventually become available. The transplant program must notify the living donor hospital or host OPO by phone and provide documentation as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours after learning of the event. b. Report the event throught the OPTN Improving Patient Safety Portal. This OPTN reporting could be completed either from the transplant hospital or by the OPO.","• This work instruction applies to all temporary, contract, and permanent employees, and visitors of Boston Children's Hospital. • This work instruction requires Lockout or Tagout to be performed when: 1.

See Authorized Medication Administration policy. 2. Check orogastric or nasogastric tube placement according to the Patient Care Manual: Insertion of Indwelling Nasogastric Feeding Tubes . Do not check placement of post-pyloric tubes. 3. Verify that enteral feeding tubing is attached to enteral route. 4. Prepare the medication. Use liquid preparations whenever possible. Crush and dissolve tablets to a fine powder using a Silent Knight® or single-patient use pill crusher. If able to remove the contents, mix the contents of a hard or soft gelatin capsule with water if a liquid form is not available. 5. Mix powdered medications with water until fully dissolved before administering into the enteral tube. 6. Administer medication via enteral syringe. 7. When preparing doses from floor stock products, for small volumes, use an appropriate sized syringe and medication straw (required for 0.5 mL-3 mL ENfit™ syringes) when drawing up the medication to ensure accurate dosing. 8. Assess exit point marking on the enteral tube prior to medication administration; refer to the Insertion of Indwelling Nasogastric Feeding Tubes policy. 9. Flush the tube with sterile water between medications and after the last one to prevent occlusions. Consider patient’s fluid allowance; refer to Enteral Tube Flushing Guidelines. Sticky or viscous medications may need a larger volume of sterile water flush to clear the tubing.","To prepare the Patient • Verify the Prescriber Order. • Verify the identity of the patient as described in the Nursing Policy and Procedure: Patient Identification. • Explain procedure to the patient and/or family to promote understanding and cooperation. • Perform hand hygiene and wear protective equipment as described in the Infection Control Manual: Hand Hygiene and Standard Precautions policies. To insert the tube • Examine the stylet/tube for a secure tube/luer fit. • Flush tube through the stylet port with water to ensure easy stylet removal after placement. • Position patient in a comfortable position, recommend elevating head of bed 15-30 degrees as tolerated. • Using the tube, approximate distance to the stomach mark (I) by measuring the distance from the tip of nose to the ear lobe, then down to the xiphoid process. Approximate the duodenal mark (II), by measuring the distance from the xiphoid process to the mid axillary line. Approximate the jejunal mark (III) by adding 5 – 10cm after the duodenal mark. • (5-7cm Newborn-1yr) • (7-10cm 1-4 yrs) • (10cm >4yrs) • Using a permanent marker, make a series of slashes along the tube at the identified measurements. • Lubricate the tip of the tube and then slowly insert tube into the nare. Direct the tube posteriorly parallel to the nasal septum. • If patient experiences any sign of respiratory distress or coughing during insertion, remove the tube. • Continue advancing tube to the first mark (gastric). • After tube is advanced to the first mark, roll patient into extreme right decubitus position as tolerated to facilitate passage of tube from stomach into duodenum. • Advance the tube to the second mark (duodenal) while simultaneously insufflating small volume of air (5-10 mL briskly), a ""subtle"" give may be noted as the feeding tube crosses the pylorus. The tube is then advanced another 5-10 cm (per above guidelines) to third mark to ensure jejunal or distal duodenal placement. • Insufflate 3-5 mL of air into the tube and then pull back on the syringe plunger. Aspiration of less than 1 mL represents a positive ""snap test"", as the plunger often snaps back into the syringe. • If snap test is not positive, gently pull tube back to the first (gastric) mark and repeat steps 13-15 until positive snap is elicited (up to 3 attempts) and then proceed to next step. • Auscultate 2-5 mL of air over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Listen for presence of high- pitched crackles. Auscultate over distal esophagus for absence of sounds. • With one hand holding feeding tube at the nare, gently remove stylet from the tube by withdrawing the stylet with your free hand. Secure tube to face with dressing and tape. Label the tube as ""post-pyloric"" and document exit mark in electronic health record. • Consider maintaining patient in right side-lying position for up to 30 minutes as tolerated to facilitate peristalsis of tube into jejunum. • Obtain KUB to confirm proper placement of post-pyloric tube. • Do not use tube until post-pyloric placement is confirmed by KUB and communicated by prescriber. ◦ Note: Tube does not have to be situated in the jejunum to be considered a successful post-pyloric placement. It needs only be located past the pylorus, preferably between the second part of the duodenum and the ligament of Treitz of jejunum. If true jejunal depth is required, please speak with the fluoroscopy department. • Re-confirmation of tube placement by KUB is necessary if there are any concerns for displacement.",4,4,1,4,3,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

Initiate use of the device per operating instructions.","Postural To perform, the nurse positions the patient so that gravity enhances mobilization of Drainage secretions from specific lobes of the lungs. Postural drainage is usually done in conjunction with percussion and vibration. If the patient is not able to tolerate postural drainage positions, modified positions (supine, side lying, prone with the head of the bed flat or elevated) may be used. Percussion Done by clapping with a cupped hand, relaxed wrist and arm, over an area of the chest wall. Percussion is done to assist with mobilization of secretions in the airways. Percussion should be done over one layer of clothing. Percussive devices may be used in place of a cupped hand. Vibration Done by placing hands on the chest wall over the area to by vibrated, and tensing the arms so that a vibrating motion travels from the arms to the patient's body. The patient is asked to take a deep breath; vibration is only done during expiration. Vibration is done to assist with mobilization of secretions.","The BCH Hospital Safety Management Program maintained a focus on quality improvement throughout the year. This focus resulted in numerous accomplishments and new developments in all aspects of the program. The following is a summary of some of the 2019 program improvements. • Collaborated with Engineering to continually improve lockout/tag-out procedures that include both shutdown procedures and personal protective equipment requirements. • Enhanced the surgical and procedural fire safety training program to allow greater hands-on participation. • Began a Peripritive Health & Safety Oversight Commitee • Code Red Root Cause Analysis Task Force - reducing false alarms and targeted improvements • Started a behavioral health employee injury steering committee • Continued to collaborate with other North American pediatric hospitals regarding employee injury prevention strategies and benchmarked improvement metrics. As a member of SPS cohorts, continued to focus on quality and safety improvements across the priority areas of slip/trip/fall prevention, prevention of employee injuries associated with overexertion and patient behavioral events. • Collaborated with Occupational Health Services and Infection Control to continue tracking and trending of sharps injuries across hospital campuses, actively engaged departments using non-safety devices to encourage transition to safety devices and involved the Supply Chain department in identifying the hospital's inventory of safety and non-safety sharps and in developing a process for flagging new purchases of non-safety sharps devices. • Established a Steering Committee charged with reviewing employee safety events associated with patient behaviors and implemented tasks forces dedicated to identifying effective training approaches for staff and to ensuring that staff are provided with appropriate resources and emotional support following events of this kind. • Using a participatory ergonomic approach, continue to support department-based safety committees in Environmental Services, Food Services and Radiology Departments with goals of involving employees directly in early identification of hazards and real-time coaching in best practices and engaging both front- line staff and department leadership in development of corrective actions. • Collaborated with Patient Safety and Quality on transition from paper-based employee safety event reporting to implementation of on-line incident reporting using rL Solutions/SERS. • Expanded safe patient handling and mobilization program efforts at BCH to include procurement of additional types and amounts of safe patient handling equipment, standardization of internal processes and equipment brands, development of educational resources for staff and increased representation of front-line staff on safe patient handling and mobilization committee. • Worked with the Radiation Safety Committee, HTM, Radiology and PPSQ, to improve x-ray safety practice througout BCH. Several recommendations were made and the primary improvement recommended was to hire an institutional x-ray safety officer. This was accomplished in September 2018. • Implemented monthly Enviroment of Care SWAT drills. • Implemented quarterly Environment of Care SWAT drill debriefs in which all units/departments who participate in the drills as well as the multi-displinary team who conducted the drills were invited to attend. • Implemented Advanced Technologies Group, Inc.

Fabrication is making up data or results and recording or reporting them. Falsification is manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record. It does not include honest error or differences of opinion. Plagiarism is the appropriation of another person’s ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit.","The shared mission for clinical and basic research is to alleviate and prevent human suffering caused by illness, and it is our aim to assist researchers that work in this common effort. We strive to maintain the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and professionalism in our research. It is imperative to maintain our patients' confidence in our studies. They must be certain that our research is well justified, and that the risks are reasonable in relation to the potential benefits. Researchers owe their primary duty to the patient and research subject, and should never place vulnerable patients at risk. Key processes for maintaining research integrity include independent peer review and oversight, replication, and accountability at each stage of research. Our Research Misconduct Policy addresses the instances in which some or all of these processes are alleged to have broken down. 7 Our primary goal is to foster an ethically responsible environment so that evidence of potential misconduct is reported in a timely manner. Equally important is informing researchers about our policies and procedures, and our commitment to institutional and governmental compliance.","Investigator Requirements for research funded by NIJ: 1.

Evaluate the airway and provide management according to the CCTT Neonatal Airway Management protocol. 2. Provide supplemental oxygen: a. Monitor pulse oximetry and adjust oxygen administration to maintain oxygen saturations according to the following guidelines: i. Term and near term (>35 weeks) infants: SpO2 >95% ii. Preterm infants (<34 weeks): SpO2 90 – 95% b. If congenital heart disease is suspected, refer to the CCTT Newborn with Suspected Congenital Heart Disease protocol for guidelines regarding oxygen saturation goals. 3. Provide ventilatory assistance to infants who are unable to maintain adequate oxygen saturations despite a FiO2 >0.6, or who have significantly increased work of breathing or signs of respiratory failure. a. Consider facial or nasal CPAP or BIPAP. b. Initiate positive pressure ventilation by bag and mask for infants with signs of inadequate ventilation. Whenever possible, use a manometer to monitor airway pressures. c. Perform endotracheal intubation when indicated according to the CCTT Neonatal Airway Management protocol. 4. For infants who are endotracheally intubated, provide ventilatory support using the following guidelines for initial management: a. Peak inspiratory pressure adequate to create chest rise and breath sounds. In general: i. Term infant: 20 – 30 cm H2O ii. Pre-term infant: 15 – 20 cm H2O NOTE: Patients with poor lung compliance may require higher initial inflating pressures, which should be adjusted as pulmonary function improves. b. Positive end-expiratory pressure at 4 – 5 cm H2O; consider increasing to 6 – 8 cm H2O for infants with pulmonary hemorrhage. c. Ventilation rate – adjust based on assessment of the infant's rate and effort, blood gases, and EtCO2. In general, the goal for pH is >7.25 and <7.40, except for patients with PPHN (refer to the CCTT Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn protocol). In general, starting ventilatory rates are as follows: 1. Term infant: 20 – 30/min 2. Pre-term infant: 30 – 40/min Note: I:E ratio will change with rate, but should not exceed 1:1. d. FiO2 – adjust based on pulse oximetry, using guidelines in #2 above. 5. For pre-term neonates (≤35 weeks) with respiratory failure and evidence of respiratory distress syndrome by radiologic evaluation (ground glass appearance, low lung volumes, air bronchograms), administer exogenous surfactant as described below. For term or near-term infants (>35 weeks), consult with the Medical Control Physician prior to surfactant administration. 6. Transport nurses may administer Curosurf® (poractant alfa) intratracheally at a dose of 2.5 mL/kg following the Boston Children's Hospital Standards for the Administration of Surfactant Replacement Therapy. 7. Especially after the administration of surfactant the infant should be observed closely during transport for changes in lung compliance and oxygenation, so that peak inspiratory pressure can be adjusted to prevent over-distension, which may result in pneumothorax, and FiO2 can be adjusted according to pulse oximetry, based on the guidelines in #2 above. 8. If a clinically significant pneumothorax is suspected or proven to be present, perform needle thoracentesis according to the CCTT Pleural Decompression protocol. Consult with the Medical Control Physician regarding placement of a chest tube following needle thoracentesis. 9. For neonates with suspected conditions that are addressed in other protocols, refer to the applicable protocol for further care (eg: Tracheoesophageal Fistula and Esophageal Atresia, Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia, Newborn with Suspected Congenital Heart Disease, Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn ). 10. Perform frequent reassessment of the patient during transport, and adjust therapy as needed based on the clinical condition.","Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is the application of a modified cardiopulmonary bypass circuit designed for extended duration use in patients with cardiac and/or respiratory failure who do not respond to conventional measures or treatments.

How can a nurse obtain access to the job documents such as the Patient Care Manual and Ambulatory Clinical Assessment if they have restricted access,0,"All elevators that service inpatient units and all inpatient unit entrance doors are restricted to badge access only. Doors to the Emergency Department are also restricted to badge access. Emergency Department staff are located at the ED entrance to allow access to patients and families. The Emergency Department waiting room is always open and accessible. After normal visiting hours, all perimeter doors and certain elevators, with the exception of the Fazalari Bridge, the ED, and front desk revolver doors, are locked. Those three entrances are staffed with Security and/or main reception services team members for access control. After 11:30pm all main entrance doors are locked and the only ways to enter or exit after that time is via the Fazalari Bridge or the ED where Security is posted. After normal business or visiting hours, satellite campuses are closed with the exception of Waltham, where the facility is accessible through the main entrance. A security officer is located at the front desk. In some emergencies, it will be necessary to restrict and control access to the facility so that those who have essential business may enter, but all others may not. The need to restrict access is determined by communication between the Incident Commander and the Security Branch Director. BCH maintains a restricted access plan to partially lock down the facility when appropriate. Security officers are staged at perimeter doors, and/or at elevators and designated hallway points. At times restricted access can be floor-specific. Staff members and physicians may still enter the building at points controlled by ID badge. Temporary ID badges can be issued once inside the building.

In research that does not involve federal funding what option does the RIO have for conducting an inquiry and investigation for a more streamlined and timely review,0,"For PHS-related research, BCH will carry out the proceeding with full adherence to the Public Health Service Policies on Research Misconduct codified in 42 CFR Part 93 including notifying ORI at appropriate times and of any facts that may be relevant to protect public health, federal funds and equipment, and the integrity of the PHS-supported research process. BCH will cooperate with ORI during its oversight review, administrative hearings, and/or appeals. BCH will assist ORI in administering and enforcing any HHS administrative action imposed on BCH staff and personnel. For research that does not involve any federal funding, the RIO may choose to appoint a panel of one or more individuals to conduct combined Inquiry and Investigation for a more streamlined and timely review.","Boston Children's Hospital complies with all applicable local, state, and federal regulations that pertain to reporting requirements. These regulations require that the following be reported: 1. Unanticipated problems that involve risks to participants or others. 2. Suspension or termination of Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval of research 3. Serious or continuing noncompliance with regulations or the requirements of the IRB. The same criteria and process for conducting investigations, making determinations about reporting, and actions taken will apply to all research regardless of funding source. The IRB reserves the right to voluntarily report any event that is not associated with federal funding to the Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP). All reporting actions are to occur within the minimal amount of time necessary to conduct complete and conclusive investigations, with a final report goal of no more than 30-days from the time an event is identified. 1. If it appears that an investigation and resolution of the event may take longer, the Institutional Official (IO) may submit an initial report with any information known to date and the time frame necessary to submit a final report. 2. If federally funded or under the jurisdiction of the FDA, the Institutional Official will submit any report on behalf of the institution. Reporting to regulatory federal agencies is not required if the Principal Investigator (PI) voluntarily closes a study to new subject accrual or temporarily halts the research procedures. In this situation, the IRB, IRB Chair, or administrative officials may recommend voluntary closure of subject recruitment and/or research activities to the PI. However, the PI makes the decision whether closure is appropriate. If the IRB or IRB Chair requires suspension or termination, the incident is reportable under this policy.","In accordance with federal regulations 45 CFR 46 and 21 CFR 50 and 56, Boston Children's Hospital allows specific categories of research to be exempt from human subject review. Any research that falls within these categories must not be subject to any state laws that would prohibit an exemption. 1. Any IRB member may determine that a human subject activity is exempt from IRB review. 2. Limited review in any of the exempt categories will be conducted by an IRB member. 3. Prisoners : The exemptions in this policy do not apply to research subject to prisoners. The only exception is for research aimed at a broader subject population that only incidentally includes prisoners. 4. Children : For federally funded studies that involve children, exemption category 2 only applies to educational tests or the observation of public behavior when the investigator(s) do not participate in the activities being observed. Exemption category 3 for benign behavioral intervention does not apply. 5. For non-federally funded research, the expanded categories below are allowed in adults, children and prisoners. 6. Boston Children's Hospital does not recognize exemption categories 7 and 8.","Federal regulations also allow for certain types of studies to be exempt from the IND regulations. Per 21 CFR 312.2, Clinical investigations of a drug product that is lawfully marketed in the United States may be exempt from the requirements of the IND regulations, provided that all of the following conditions apply: 1. The study is not intended to be reported to the FDA as a well-controlled study in support of a new indication or use; or support any significant change in the drug's labeling; 2. The study is not intended to support a significant change in the advertising for a prescribed drug; 3. The study does not involve a change in route of administration, dosage level, patient population, or other factors that significantly increases the risks associated with use of the drug product; 4. The study complies with IRB evaluation and informed consent requirements; and 5. The study sponsor and/or investigator do not represent in a promotional context that the drug is safe and effective for the purposes in which it is under investigation. When research involves the use of a drug other than the use of a marketed drug in the course of medical practice, the regulations also provide for additional exemptions from the IND regulations: 1. A clinical investigation is for an in vitro diagnostic biological product that involves one or more of the following: Blood grouping serum, reagent red blood cells, anti-human globulin. a. The diagnostic test is intended to be used in a diagnostic procedure that confirms the diagnosis made by another, medically established, diagnostic product or procedure. b. The diagnostic test is shipped in compliance with 21 CFR 312.160 C. 2. A clinical investigation involving use of a placebo if the investigation does not otherwise require submission of an IND. (See 21 CFR 312.2 for a full description of exempt categories)","FDA CFR 50.24 The IRB responsible for the review, approval, and continuing review of the clinical investigation described in this section may approve that investigation without requiring that informed consent of all subjects be obtained if the IRB (with the concurrence of a licensed physician who is a member of the IRB and who is not otherwise participating in the clinical investigation, if subject to FDA regulations) finds and documents each of the following: 1. The human subjects are in a life-threatening situation, available treatments are unproven or unsatisfactory, and the collection of valid scientific evidence, which may include evidence obtained through randomized placebo-controlled investigations, is necessary to determine the safety and effectiveness of particular interventions. 2. Obtaining informed consent is not feasible because: a. The subjects will not be able to give their informed consent as a result of their medical condition. b. The intervention under investigation must be administered before consent from the subject's legally authorized representatives is feasible; and c. There is no reasonable way to identify prospectively the individuals likely to become eligible for participation in the clinical investigation. 3. Participation in the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the subjects because: a. Subjects are facing a life-threatening situation that necessitates intervention; b. Appropriate animal and other preclinical studies have been conducted, and the information derived from those studies and related evidence support the potential for the intervention to provide a direct benefit to the individual subjects; and c. Risks associated with the investigation are reasonable in relation to what is known about the medical condition of the potential class of subjects, the risks and benefits of standard therapy, if any, and what is known about the risks and benefits of the proposed intervention or activity. 4. The clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out without the waiver. 5. The proposed investigation plan defines the length of the potential therapeutic window based on scientific evidence, and the investigator has committed to attempting to contact a legally authorized representative for each subject within that window of time and, if feasible, to ask the legally authorized representative contacted for consent within that window rather than proceeding without consent. The investigator will summarize efforts made to contact a legally authorized representative and make this information available to the IRB at the time of continuing review. 6. The IRB has reviewed and approved informed consent procedures and an informed consent document. These procedures and the informed consent document are to be used with subjects or their legally authorized representatives in situations where use of such procedures and documents is feasible. The IRB has reviewed and approved procedures and information to be used when providing an opportunity for a family member to object to a subject's participation in the clinical investigation consistent with paragraph (7)(v) below. 7. Additional protections of the rights and welfare of the subjects will be provided, including, at least: i. Consultation (including, where appropriate, consultation carried out by the IRB) with representatives of the communities in which the clinical investigation will be conducted and from which the subjects will be drawn; ii. Public disclosure to the communities in which the clinical investigation will be conducted and from which the subjects will be drawn, prior to initiation of the clinical investigation, of plans for the investigation and its risks and expected benefits; iii. Public disclosure of sufficient information following completion of the clinical investigation to apprise the community and researchers of the study, including the demographic characteristics of the research population, and its results; iv. Establishment of an independent data monitoring committee to exercise oversight of the clinical investigation; and v. If obtaining informed consent is not feasible and a legally authorized representative is not reasonably available, the investigator has committed, if feasible, to attempting to contact within the therapeutic window the subject's family member who is not a legally authorized representative, and asking whether he or she objects to the subject's participation in the clinical investigation. The investigator will summarize efforts made to contact family members and make this information available to the IRB at the time of continuing review. a. The IRB is responsible for ensuring that procedures are in place to inform, at the earliest feasible opportunity, each subject, or if the subject remains incapacitated, a legally authorized representative of the subject, or if such a representative is not reasonably available, a family member, of the subject's inclusion in the clinical investigation, the details of the investigation and other information contained in the informed consent document. The IRB shall also ensure that there is a procedure to inform the subject, or if the subject remains incapacitated, a legally authorized representative of the subject, or if such a representative is not reasonably available, a family member, that he or she may discontinue the subject's participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled. If a legally authorized representative or family member is told about the clinical investigation and the subject's condition improves, the subject is also to be informed as soon as feasible. If a subject is entered into a clinical investigation with waived consent and the subject dies before a legally authorized representative or family member can be contacted, information about the clinical investigation is to be provided to the subject's legally authorized representative or family member, if feasible. b. The IRB determinations required by § 50.25(a) of this section and the documentation required by § 50.25(e) of this section are to be retained by the IRB for at least 3 years after completion of the clinical investigation, and the records shall be accessible for inspection and copying by FDA in accordance with § 56.115(b). c. Protocols involving an exception to the informed consent requirement under this section must be performed under a separate investigational new drug application (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE) that clearly identifies such protocols as protocols that may include subjects who are unable to consent. The submission of those protocols in a separate IND/IDE is required even if an IND for the same drug product or an IDE for the same device already exists. Applications for investigations under this section may not be submitted as amendments under § 312.30 or 812.35. d. If an IRB determines that it cannot approve a clinical investigation because the investigation does not meet the criteria in the exception provided under § 50.25(a) of this section or because of other relevant ethical concerns, the IRB must document its findings and provide these findings promptly in writing to the clinical investigator and to the sponsor of the clinical investigation. The sponsor of the clinical investigation must promptly disclose this information to FDA, when the project is under the jurisdiction of the FDA and to the sponsor's clinical investigators who are participating or are asked to participate in this or a substantially equivalent clinical investigation of the sponsor, and to other IRBs that have been, or are asked to review this or a substantially equivalent investigation by that sponsor. Additional HHS requirements: HHS 45 CFR 46.101(i): a. In accordance with HHS regulations the ""Emergency Research Consent Waiver"" does not apply to research involving prisoners, fetuses, pregnant women and human in vitro fertilization. b. The IRB must approve the research, waiver, and document that the research activity is subject to regulations codified by the FDA Title 21 CFR part 50 and will be carried out under an FDA investigational new drug application (IND) or an FDA investigational device exemption (IDE). The application for which has clearly identified the protocols that would include subjects who are unable to consent, and c. That: i. The requirements for exception from informed consent for emergency research detailed in title 21 CFR section 50.24 have been met relative to those protocols, or ii.

Under what circumstances should CPAP therapy be initiated during a diagnostic study for a splitnight study,1,"1. A split-night study is initiated upon an order from a physician. a. CPAP therapy should be initiated during the diagnostic study in the following criteria have been met: b. A minimum of 2 hours of diagnostic PSG with an AHI of at least 30. c. Split night may be considered at an AHI of 15-40 based on clinical judgment. d. An AHI greater than 20 with documented symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired cognition, mood disorders, insomnia, documented hypertension, ischemic heart disease, or history of stroke. e. CPAP could be initiated during the diagnostic PSG by the technician as an emergency measure when multiple apneas leading to sever oxygen desaturation (below 70%) and/or prolonged apneas (more than 60 seconds) are observed by the technician during the diagnostic PSG with a minimum of 2 hours of sleep documented. f. Must be at least 3 hours remaining study time for the CPAP titration. g. Follow our sleep lab CPAP protocol.","1. Start CPAP at 5cw (< or > for patient comfort) and titrate upward by 1cw to eliminate obstruction; increase pressure if: a. ≥ 1 obstructive apnea, or ≥ 2 obstructive hypopneas with ≥ 3% oxygen desaturation and/or EEG arousal. b. Persistent snoring: If < 12 years at least > 1 minute of snoring and if > 12 years > 3 minutes of snoring. 2. Pressure should be increased slowly with a minimum of 5 minutes between 1cw increases. 3. Maximum CPAP pressure for children < 12 years is 15cw and max pressure for children > 12 years is 20cw (unless otherwise specified by ordering provider); 4. Optimal titration is where all obstructive events and snoring is resolved. Acceptable titration is where the obstructive RDI is < 5/hour; 5. Use expiratory pressure relief as needed and appropriate (e.g. C-flex or EPR); 6. Monitor and document mask leak with increasing pressure (ideally it must be < 25 LPM accounting for mask leak bias); 7. Monitor the C-flow (NAP) on PSG to assess for flow limitation, observe carefully for appearance of central apnea and hypopnea which indicates over-titration. 8. Notate in designated column pressure changes as well as reason for change in pressure. Also note pressure changes in recording software. 9. List all mask types (brand, model and size) used, including masks that were unsuccessful. 10. Patient-specific orders by the sleep provider may override the above guidelines, particularly when CPAP is used for reasons other than uncomplicated OSA (e.g. to treat central hypoventilation); 11. When patient specific guidelines are not provided, the standard lab CPAP titration guidelines should be applied. If the CPAP titrations instructions are not clear, or any other problems are encountered during the study, the sleep fellow/provider on call should be contacted for further instructions. In addition, the sleep fellow/provider on call should also be contacted for further guidance if significant changes occur (weight gain, surgery) or a significant time since previous study (6 + months) or evidence for existence of OSA. The severity of OSA should be known before beginning the CPAP titration. Important : A Mask Fitting should be done one week before the scheduled study to identify the most suitable mask for the child and allow time for home habituation. Some children are able to have a mask fitting on the night of the study; two mask options will be explored should an alternate mask be required. The study must begin with the best fitting mask and monitored for leak (< 25 LPM) and discomfort. Details of the mask used, including the make, model, size and use of chin strap (when applicable) should be clearly documented in the tech notes. A full-face mask is utilized only after a nasal mask and chin strap have proven to be ineffective. Children who are not able to remove a full-face mask require prior approval from a Sleep physician.","1. If a mask leak occurs, the tech should first fix the leakage before raising the pressure. Otherwise, the final pressure setting chosen for the patient may be too high. Once the mask leak has been fixed, decrease the pressure to the last setting where mouth breathing and/or mask leakage was not present, and then re- titrate as indicated. Make sure to document directly on the study the steps taken to resolve the leak and the type of masks used. Pressure settings usually do not need to be set as high with a nasal-mask than with a full-face mask. 2. The recoding technologist should document directly on the study at least every 30 minutes. 3. If the patient takes a break from wearing the mask, do not decrease the CPAP pressure on attempted return to sleep unless the patient remains awake for 15 minutes or the patient specifically requests that the pressure be lowered. 4. Do not raise pressure settings for central apneas. If the patient develops central apneas, periodic breathing, pressure setting may need to be lowered. 5. The use of bi-level positive airway pressure may be indicated if the patient is unable to tolerate CPAP secondary due to any of the following: 1) Persistent mouth breathing despite use of a full-face mask/chin strap; 2) Inability to exhale against higher expiratory pressures (typically beginning anywhere from 15 to 20 cm of water); or 3) Frequent central apneas. Document directly on the study why the patient is being switched from CPAP to Bi-PAP. 6. Ensure that supine sleep has been seen on the chosen setting. Going above the chosen setting by one or two cm of water to show range may be helpful to ensure that the correct pressure has been established. Pressure levels may need to be increased more quickly during REM sleep given the limited amount of REM during sleep and the need to treat events during this stage.","1.

These will accommodate nasal tubes of the same size • Consider need for anti-anxiety, appropriate comfort measures, and age-appropriate distraction techniques.","• Obtain a Gastroenterology (GI) consult prior to discharge to establish follow-up, and discuss a plan for replacement of tube when needed. • In general, if oral intake is expected to improve over the first year of life (for example, feeding immaturity related to prematurity or aspiration), nasal tubes may be a viable option for discharge to home, after discussion with the family. ◦ Pros: Avoidance of surgery/laparoscopy, temporary nature of the tube ◦ Cons: Tubes prone to dislodgement, need to maintain tube on the face, nasal congestion/obstruction from the tube • Patients are generally discharged with a post-pyloric tube (versus NG) if they improved with inpatient post-pyloric feedings, and/or continue to have severe illness that prompted the original placement of the post-pyloric tube (e.g. respiratory, neuromuscular, or GER), especially if being transferred to a rehabilitation facility (versus home). • Specific considerations for home post-pyloric feeding that should be discussed amongst the medical team, GI consulting service, and family are: ◦ Replacement of dislodged post-pyloric tubes does not occur at home, in a clinic, or in most locals Emergency Departments. The infant would likely need to present to the BCH ED to replace the tube via fluoroscopy. ◦ Post-pyloric feeds run continuously, over a majority of the hours per day, which may complicate activities, especially in the outpatient setting.","Please refer to NICU Enteral Feeding Guideline for further details.

How long do Multiple Wakefulness Tests MWT trials typically last and under what circumstances may a 20minute trial be ordered,1,"The sleep facility performs MWTs in accordance with AASM practice parameters and published guidelines. MWT is indicated to assess a person's ability to remain awake when his or her inability to remain awake constitutes a public or personal safety issue. MWT may be indicated in patients with excessive daytime sleepiness to assess response to treatment. MWT must be ordered or approved by an appropriately licensed facility medical staff member. The need to perform a PSG prior to MWT is determined by the staff physician based on clinical circumstances. MWT trials last 40 minutes. On occasion the staff physician may order 20-minute trials (e.g., for FAA requirements).","The sleep facility performs MWTs in accordance with AASM practice parameters and published guidelines.

The physician based on clinical circumstances decides performance of a PSG prior to MWT. MWT trials last 40 minutes. On occasion the staff physician may order 20 minute trials (e.g., for FAA requirements).","The MWT consists of four trials performed at two-hour intervals. The first trial begins about one and a half to three hours after the patient's usual wake-up time. It is recommended that each trial last 40 minutes if no sleep occur. • Performance of a PSG prior to MWT will be decided by the clinician based on clinical circumstances • A light breakfast is provided about one hour prior to the first trial, and a light lunch is provided immediately after the end of the second trial. • Between trials, the patient is kept out of bed and is visually monitored to ensure that no napping occurs. • During each test, the patient sits in a semi-reclining position (45–90 degrees) on the bed in a dimly lit room (a 7.5 W night light is positioned slightly behind the patient's head so that it is just out of the patient's field of vision), and the patient is told to try to stay awake. The patient will be seated with the back and the head supported by the bedrest (bolster pillow so that the neck is not uncomfortably flexed or extended, or in a chair with backrest. • The recording is terminated after 40 minutes if no sleep occurs. If the patient falls asleep during the 40 minutes, then the trial is terminated after unequivocal sleep, defined as three consecutive epochs of stage N1 sleep or one epoch of any other stage of sleep. • The MWT is recorded with standard polysomnography using the following montage: REOG, LEOG, chin EMG, EEG (C3-M2 or C4-M1), EEG (O2-M1 or O1-M2) and EKG. The mean sleep latency is determined across four trials. • Sleep latency is defined as the time from lights out to the first epoch of any stage of sleep scored according to the most current version of the AASM Scoring Manual v.2.6.0.","1. The MWT should consist of four 40-minute wake trials. The initial trial should begin 1.5–3 hours after termination of the preceding night's sleep at home, and a subsequent trial should begin 2 hours after the start of the prior trial.The need to perform a PSG prior to MWT is determined by the staff physician based on clinical circumstances. 2. A light breakfast is provided about one hour prior to the first trial, and a light lunch is provided immediately after the end of the second trial. 3. Between trials the patient is kept out of bed and is visually monitored to ensure that no napping occurs. 4. During each test, the patient sits in a semi-reclining position (45–90 degrees) on the bed. Sleep rooms should be dimly lit, quiet, and at a comfortable temperature during testing. The light source should deliver an illuminance of 0.1–0.13 lux at the corneal level (such as a 7.5-watt nightlight) placed 12 inches off the floor and 3 feet lateral to the patient's head. The patient should be given sufficient time to acclimate to the recording room before the start of the first trial. 5. The patient should be seated in a bed or reclining chair with the back and head comfortably supported. This should be the same for all wake trials. Before each wake trial, the patient should be offered the use of the restroom and queried regarding other requirements for comfort. 6. Patient bio-calibrations should be conducted before starting each wake trial. Standard instructions include: (1)""sit quietly with your eyes open for 30seconds""; (2)""close both eyes for 30 seconds""; (3)""without moving your head, look to the right, then left, then right, then left, right and then left""; (4)""blink eyes slowly for 5 times""; and (5)""clench or grit your teeth tightly together."" Before the trials, patients should be instructed to refrain from activities and vocalizations that promote wakefulness such as fidgeting or singing. 7. At the start of each wake trial, the patient should be instructed as follows: ""Please sit still and remain awake for as long as possible. Look directly ahead of you, and do not look directly at the light. ""Testing starts immediately after instructions are given, and bedroom lights are turned off. 8. The recording is terminated after 40 minutes if no sleep occurs. If the patient falls asleep during the 40 minutes, then the trial is terminated after unequivocal sleep, defined as three consecutive epochs of stage N1 sleep or one epoch of any other stage of sleep. 9. Stimulating activities such as consuming nicotine and the use of electronic devices and cell phones should end at least 30 minutes before each wake trial. Vigorous physical activity and prolonged exposures to sunlight/bright artificial light should be avoided all day. 10. Between wake trials, the patient should be out of bed and not permitted to sleep 11. The recording montage for the MWT should, at a minimum, include 3 EEG recording leads with 1 each for frontal (F3-M1 or F4-M2), central (C3-M2 orC4-M1), and occipital (O1-M2 or O2-M1) derivations, left and right eye EOGs, mental/submental EMG, and EKG 12. Audiovisual recordings must be made during the wake trials and be accessible to interpreting sleep specialists. The patient must be audiovisually monitored throughout the day, but retention of recordings made between trials is discretionary. The mean sleep latency is determined across four trials. 13. Sleep latency is defined as the time from lights out to the first epoch of any stage of sleep scored according to the most current version of the AASM Scoring Manual. 14. Urine drug screening should be employed when indicated to ensure that the MWT results are not confounded by inadvertent, intentional, or illicit medication or substance use.","A standard MWT protocol that is consistent with AASM practice parameters promotes consistency, allows comparisons between tests, and ensures accurate interpretations that are consistent with published data.

Who is the Cochair Approval for the onboarding process,0,"Prior to enrollment: An EPCS site supervisor is approved by the Chief Pharmacy Officer or their designee. During enrollment: Another EPCS enrollment site supervisor visualizes the proposed EPCS site supervisor’s current federal or state identification. The visualization is documented during the Google Authenticator enrollment process, see below. The Pharmacy Department, CHAMPS and Clinical Education and Informatics personnel will manage the process of provisioning and deprovisioning. Virtual (remote) provisioning will be the primary mechanism. In person provisioning will occur in emergent situations (e.g. off hours by the ED Pharmacy) or during annual onboarding sessions.","The hiring process for Medical Staff begins by identifying the type of clinical services needed, the level of clinical experience, the academic qualifications and level sought, administrative and other department needs, and various other considerations. From an administrative perspective, as an initial matter, department staff involved with the recruitment and onboarding process should understand whether a “Search” will be conducted (see below). Once a candidate is selected, administrative staff should be familiar with the terms of employment, what services the recruited Medical Staff will perform and whether the employer will be the Foundation or BCH. Additionally, staff should know where and when the Medical Staff will need hospital privileges, the type of Medical Staff membership sought (e.g., Active, Affiliate or Adjunct), what level of faculty appointment will be requested, and the timeline for hire. These steps are described in more detail below. See the process map in the appendix.","Medical Staff hiring and onboarding at BCH is a multi-faceted process requiring careful coordination and the involvement of multiple departments. This Administrative Guide is designed to help administrative staff directly involved with the hiring and onboarding process navigate these processes. Administrative staff may be asked to assist with the hiring and onboarding of Medical Staff with different types of faculty appointments; Medical Staff with privileges at one or more hospitals and/or in one or more clinical departments; Medical Staff with research activities; Medical Staff who are moving from trainee status to the level of an Attending; Medical Staff who are employed by BCH; physicians who are employed by a Foundation; Medical Staff with immigration needs; and Medical Staff with a variety of other needs and circumstances that may be unique to the department or the individual. While no procedural document can anticipate every process or circumstance, this Administrative Guide outlines each of the major administrative processes that touch the hiring and onboarding of BCH employed Medical Staff. Users of this Administrative Guide should note a few important caveats: First, this Administrative Guide does not cover Medical Staff selection processes or criteria, nor does it address Medical Staff compensation. Second, this Guide does not cover administrative processes for House Staff (Interns, Residents and Clinical Fellows); please contact the Graduate Medical Education office or the Human Resources Service Center for questions about onboarding and orientation of House Staff if you need assistance with processes for House Staff. Third, this Guide does not cover administrative processes specifically related to Medical Staff employment by the Foundations. Please refer to the Administrative Guide to Onboarding Non-BCH Employed Medical Staff for administrative processes for Medical Staff employed by a Foundation. Lastly, administrative requirements change, as do processes and systems. BCH is doing a multi-phase upgrade of PeopleSoft and has recently implemented an electronic credentialing system. These changes, along with others that will happen as BCH grows and improves, may mean some variation. This Administrative Guide will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect changes in practice and process.","The BCH Medical Staff member will continue to be the responsible/admitting Medical Staff Member for the patient 1.

Only members of the research team who have experience in all elements of the study may provide a complete and accurate description of the research, and answer questions and concerns. 4. Even when responsibilities for obtaining informed consent are delegated, the investigator always remains responsible for assuring an adequate process to obtain informed consent. Special considerations include the technicality of the details of the protocol, and who can best explain them. For example, research that involves the use of an investigational drug will likely require that a physician member of the research team obtain informed consent. 5. Who is best able to answer the questions that may come up? It may be advantageous to have two individuals involved in the consent process. 6. Often the investigator provides information, and a research nurse is made available to follow-up and provide additional information. 7.

Assess catheter patency at a minimum of every hour or as otherwise prescribed.,"Species Covered: All Vertebrate Species 1. All investigators who propose to transport and use reusable, non-critical clinical equipment for an animal study in ARCH facilities must obtain approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), the Medical Director of Infection Prevention and Control/Hospital Epidemiologist (or designee), and the Chairperson/Chief or Director of the clinical unit providing the equipment. 2. Per recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), any clinical instrument or device classified as semi-critical or critical (see below) that is used in an animal procedure is restricted from future use in humans. In addition, no clinical equipment from sterile procedure areas (i.e., OR, cardiac catheterization lab, interventional radiology, etc.), can be transported and used for animal research, then returned for use on humans. Personnel from Central Processing are available to help investigators source clinical equipment, as needed. 3. As part of the IACUC animal use protocol application, investigators must obtain the signature of the Infection Prevention and Control program representative and the Chairperson/Chief or Director of the clinical area on the protocol application prior to submission of the animal protocol. a. The signature of the Chairperson/Chief/Director of the clinical unit will signify to the IACUC that the leadership of the clinical unit is aware of and approves the transport and use of their patient care equipment for animal studies. The Chairperson/Chief/Director or designee must speak with investigators about appropriate times for scheduling use of equipment, cleaning according to infection prevention and control guidelines, and staffing as necessary prior to signing the Use of Clinical Equipment for Animal Studies form. b. The signature of the Infection Prevention and Control program representative will signify to the IACUC that the investigator and infection prevention and control have discussed and agreed to methods of transportation and sanitization. 4. No final approval by the IACUC on the animal protocol will be granted until all signatures are obtained. 5. Scheduling a. Use of non-critical clinical equipment from clinical units is not permitted during regular business hours of the unit. Clinical departments may have preferences for off-hour use of clinical equipment (evenings, early morning, weekends). i. It is up to the department and the investigator to decide upon the appropriate time to borrow equipment for animal studies. ii. Factors to consider are the sanitization needs and technical staff requirements. 6. Transport of Non-Critical Clinical Equipment a. Non-critical clinical equipment must be transported to ARCH in a manner that prevents damage to the equipment and contamination of the environment. i. The investigator is responsible for assuring that, after use, reusable clinical equipment is handled and transported in a manner that is consistent with hospital infection prevention and control policy and OSHA regulations for protection of healthcare workers. 7. Sanitation a. Reusable clinical equipment must be appropriately cleaned and disinfected following use. The methods for accomplishing this will depend on the equipment, how it is used and the species of animal it will be used for. i. It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to assure that equipment is cleaned appropriately and to schedule additional cleaning with the clinical unit providing the equipment.

What are the guidelines for administration of medication by the enteral tube route as mentioned in the document,1,"• Administration of medication by the enteral tube route includes nasogastric, orogastric, gastrostomy, naso, post-pyloric (jejunal or duodenal), and gastro-jejunal tubes. • DO NOT use parenteral (IV) syringes to administer enteral medications. • Administer enteral medications via the enteral route in a safe and therapeutic manner and maintain tube patency. • Use a new syringe for flushing after medication administration. • Do not routinely administer medications via post-pyloric tube route due to concern for altered absorption and potential alteration in drug efficacy. ◦ Administer only liquid medications by the post-pyloric route. If no liquid preparation is available, dissolve medication in liquid with no visible particles prior to administration. Discuss alternative medications and dosage formulations with Pharmacy and prescriber. ◦ Dilute post-pyloric liquid medications with an equal volume of sterile water at a minimum. This practice can be modified for fluid sensitive patients. Contact Pharmacy or prescriber for recommendations. • If patient is stable (tolerating medications on home regimen and tube is not clogging), home routine may be continued when inpatient. • Administer medications in a consistent manner to maintain therapeutic levels. • Crush and dissolve tablets before administration. • Some medications cannot be administered via an enteral tube because they can precipitate, cause bezoars, clog, or degrade the tube, even when mixed well. • Do not administer the following medications through an enteral tube ◦ Clarithromycin ◦ Ciprofloxacin ◦ Kayexalate (can be given through a gastric tube) ◦ Magnesium Oxide ◦ Metamucil ◦ Sucralfate ◦ Thorazine oral concentrate • Do not crush the following forms of medication given via the enteral tube route: Dosage Form Rationale Examples • Sustained Avoid potential adverse effects associated with higher than Cardizem release expected peak concentration followed by subtherapeutic levels. SR Dimetapp extend tabs Controlled Crushing destroys this property and makes the drug immediate Oxycontin release release; can result in supratherapeutic levels immediately followed by subtherapeutic concentrations. Sublingual/ Lose effectiveness when delivered by unintended route. Nitroglycerin Buccal Sprinkles/ The beads may clog the tube. Depakote Granules Enteric Medication protection provided by coating is removed which can Ibuprofen coated cause GI upset and drug inactivation. Uneven coating particles can tablets clog tube. Chewable When crushed, consistency is more likely to clog tube. Exception: multivitamins tablets chewable aspirin if crushed and dissolved in water. ◦ Refer to the Boston Children’s Hospital Formulary for additional information. ◦ Call the Pharmacy for additional options. • Administer medications separately by the enteral tube route rather than in combination. • Do not add medications to enteral feeding syringes or bags. If infusing enteral medications that require a pump, use a NeoMed Medfusion ® pump: • Due to the differences in pH between the stomach and small intestine, any medication requiring monitoring of therapeutic levels (i.e. Depakote) needs levels rechecked after change in route i.e. post- pyloric to gastric. Doses may need to be adjusted. Contact Pharmacy for further instructions.","1. Flush the enteral tube well with water between each medication. Refer to Enteral Tube Flushing Guidelines . 2. If a patient vomits a medication, determine by consultation with prescriber, whether the dose needs to be repeated. 3. For the management of enteral tube occlusions, refer to Managing Enteral Feeding Tubes Obstructions Reference Tool. 4. Patients stabilized on long-term medications at home or in an extended care facility may continue their preparation, timing, and medication administration regimen as written by the prescriber.","• Therapeutic interchange allows Pharmacists to convert specific parenteral (IV) medications to equivalent enteral (PO, NG, etc.) medications. • Pharmacists review parenteral medication orders to determine if patient meets criteria for parenteral to enteral therapeutic interchange. • The medications outlined by this guideline are: ◦ acetaminophen Pharmacists utilize defined inclusion and exclusion criteria when making therapeutic interchange decisions: Inclusion criteria for all approved medications: • Clinically stable and improving determined through assessment of medical record and conversation with patient nurse/team if needed • Tolerating other medications or enteral nutrition by the oral/enteral route ◦ Greater than or equal to half goal enteral feeds ◦ If on trophic feeding (feeding of minute volumes of enteral feeds in order to stimulate the development of the immature gastrointestinal tract), begin enteral medication if the patient has tolerated other enteral medications Exclusion criteria for all approved medications: • 1. NPO including medications • 2. Intolerance to a component of enteral formulation • 3. Dysfunctional feeding tube • 4. Presence of active vomiting or diarrhea (> 3 loose stools/day) • 5. GI obstruction, malabsorption syndrome, motility disorder or ileus • 6. Active GI bleed • 7. BMT/oncology patient with mucositis • 8. Enrollment in a clinical trial where the drug is part of the study protocol • The pharmacist will change the route of administration of outlined medication(s) in accordance with the established criteria.","• A Medication order for Kayexalate ® or sevelamer is required to decant enteral feeds. The order for decanting with Kayexalate ® or sevelamer contains specific instructions regarding dose (in grams), route of administration (referred to as zzz Other), and volume of enteral feeds. The medication should be scanned to document on the Medication Administration Record (MAR). Of note, Kayexalate ® liquid is not recommended for decanting enteral feeds as increased aluminum levels have been associated with its use. • Refer to Formulary for dosing. • Kayexalate ® for decanting is dispensed from the pharmacy as a powder in a patient-specific measured dose. Sevelamer for decanting is dispensed from the pharmacy as 0.8 gram or 2.4 gram powder packets. • The decanting efficacy may be reduced for formulas containing fiber or when adding rice cereal to enteral feeds. • Careful monitoring of electrolytes is strongly recommended for patients receiving feeds decanted with Kayexalate ® , as it can result in electrolyte abnormalities including a reduction in potassium, calcium, and magnesium as well as an increase in sodium. Additional free water may be required in the setting of hypernatremia.Decanting with sevelamer does not significantly change the macronutrient content, however it can result in reduction in calcium when used to decant EBM. • Occasionally, patients may require enteral feeds to be decanted with both Kayexalate ® and sevelamer. If this is the case, Kayexalate ® should be used first , and sevelamer second.","• Never aspirate to check placement or residuals. • Never place to suction. • Post-pyloric tube feedings are generally delivered continuously via enteral pump. • Note: Avoid bolus feedings via post-pyloric tubes , as the duodenum and jejunum cannot readily accommodate the volume of fluid that the stomach can hold. Instillation of large volumes of fluid may result in pain and potential perforation of the intestine. • Limit medication administration due to increased risk of tube occlusion, medication absorption concerns. Consult Pharmacy as needed. • Flush every 4 hours with water to maintain patency.",4,4,0,0,4,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

This includes assessment, planning, monitoring, physical care, medication management, pain management, patient/family education, discharge planning, and continuous evaluation of care. Registered Nurses (RNs) coordinate care with the interdisciplinary team. They work collaboratively with physicians, pharmacists, social workers, child life specialists, nutrition support staff, physical therapists, nurse practitioners and pastoral care to meet comprehensive patient needs. The 43-bed unit has 21 single rooms and 11 double rooms. All bed spaces have the capability to support cardiac, respiratory, and pulse oximetry monitoring. The hours of operation are 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.","The nurse staffing for 10NW includes registered nurses and clinical assistants. Registered nurse range in experience from new graduate nurses to staff with over 30 years clinical practice on 10NW. Nurses on 10NW work 8 and 12 hour shifts to provide maximum support of the patient flow on the unit. As a surgical unit, many patients are admitted in the afternoon and evening. The combination of 8- and 12-hour shifts provide additional staff during peak times. Unit resources such as Patient Experience Representatives are considered when planning staffing. Staffing plans are arranged to accommodate the specific patient populations on 10NW. For example, staffing for spinal fusion patients for the first 16 hours is planned at a 1:2 nurse/patient ratio. The schedule is arranged by a Registered Nurse trained in assignment-making to ensure the appropriate mix of staff each shift seven days a week. The time scheduler ensures that there is a sufficient number of experienced staff on each shift so more experienced RNs are available as clinical resources to RNs with less proficiency. In addition, an RN specifically trained in the role of the Charge Nurse is assigned on each shift. The Charge Nurse provides management of daily unit operations, serves as clinical resource to staff, and ensures that appropriate chain of command is initiated when necessary. Approximately one quarter of the staff belong to the Leadership Group, which is comprised of Level II and Level III staff nurses who act as clinical leaders and participate in the development, implementation and evaluation of unit goals.

What are the specific situations that require gown and glove use for contact with patients known to be colonized with a MDRO,0,"Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) are an important problem in healthcare facilities in the United States and the world. Preventing transmission of these organisms is a key priority of infection prevention and control programs. The following provides a rational approach for managing patients who are known to harbor MDRO, based upon the setting of care. 1. Use Contact Precautions for any patient with colonization or infection with a multidrug resistant organism when: ◦ The patient is admitted to the hospital. ◦ The patient is seen in the Emergency Department. ◦ The patient is seen in a high-risk ambulatory setting that performs invasive procedures, e.g., ▪ CATCR and Waltham Infusion Center ▪ Gastroenterology Procedures Unit (GPU) ▪ Cardiac Catheterization Lab ▪ Interventional Radiology ▪ Other imaging with sedation ▪ Dialysis ▪ OR and PACU 2. Use Standard Precautions only for patients who are known to be colonized with a MDRO in low risk ambulatory settings (i.e., primary care, pre-op clinic and specialty clinics). Ensure gown and glove use for contact with pressure ulcers, draining wounds, uncontrolled secretions, stool incontinence and ostomy bags. ◦ Exception : Use Enhanced Contact Precautions for all patients with CF (cystic fibrosis) in all settings of care. 3. Use transmission-based precautions (i.e., Droplet , Contact , Airborne ) in all settings of care as needed for patients who are known or suspected to be infected by microorganisms spread by airborne, droplet or contact transmission. Transmission-based precautions are always used in addition to Standard Precautions","• Contact Precautions are needed for all inpatient admissions, ED visits, and high-risk ambulatory settings that perform invasive procedures • Confirm the patient has multidrug resistant organism (MDRO) Contact Precautions listed in the banner bar • Standard Precautions are to be followed for patients who are known to be colonized with a MDRO coming through the PCCC ◦ Ensure gown and glove use for contact with pressure ulcers, draining wounds, uncontrolled secretions, stool incontinence, and ostomy bags ◦ Note contact precautions in the PAEF ""Special Needs"" list • Refer to Infection Prevention Control Manual Entry for Management of Patients with MDRO as noted below in ""Related Content"" for further details","1. Alert Infection Prevention & Control Department on-call pager 2058 when a patient arrives with a history of MDRO from another facility to assure appropriate flagging in the medical record. 2. Patients with MDRO are flagged for Contact Precautions in the electronic medical record (PowerChart) via an order for ""ongoing precautions"". 3. Patients with MDRO are flagged in EPIC via ""Notices"" and ""Special Needs"". 4. When a patient has an ongoing precautions flag in PowerChart but not in EPIC (or vice versa), contact Infection Prevention and Control via pager 2058. 5. Ongoing precautions should not be discontinued without input from the Infection Prevention and Control Department. 6. Criteria to discontinue Contact Precautions for patients with a history of MRSA or VRE colonization/ infection have been established (Criteria for Discontinuing Contact Precautions for MRSA or VRE).","Patient Placement 1. Patient placement is dependent upon several factors, such as, the infecting organism, the age and hygiene of the patient, and the availability of single patient rooms. 2. A single patient room is required when a patient is colonized or infected with the following epidemiologically significant microorganisms: Clostridium difficile , selected multidrug-resistant gram negative rods (e.g., ESBL producers, carbapenem-resistant enteric Gram negative rods) MRSA, VISA (Vancomycin-intermediate resistant Staphylococcus aureus ), VRSA (Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ), VRE, and any other microorganism(s) stipulated by the Infection Prevention and Control Department. 3. In the event a single patient room is required but unavailable, consult Infection Control on-call (pager 2058) for guidance. 4. When two or more patients are colonized or infected with the same organism (e.g., rotavirus, RSV, influenza) cohorting of patients may be appropriate. Refer to the Infection Prevention & Control Tool: Patient Cohorting Guidelines or consult with Infection Control on-call for guidance. 5. The placement of two or more patients with similar clinical diagnoses may be appropriate as, long as the required precautions are followed. Refer to the Infection Control Tool: Patient Cohorting Guidelines or consult with Infection Control on-call for guidance. 6. Place a Contact Precautions sign, in a visible location, outside the patient's room. 7. For patients with Aerosol Generating Procedures (AGP), post the appropriate AGP sign with the Contact Precautions sign. 8. Order Contact Precautions to activate the banner bar precaution flag in the patient's electronic medical record. Personal Protective Attire 1. Wear gloves to enter patient's room. Change gloves, as needed, after having contact with infectious material such as fecal material or wound drainage. 2. Wear a gown when entering a patient's room to prevent contact of skin and clothing with the patient, the patient's bed and/or other equipment within the room. 3. Remove and discard gown and gloves , in patient's room, after each use. 4. Perform hand hygiene immediately after removal of protective attire. Use soap and water instead of alcohol-based hand sanitizer when caring for a patient with Clostridium difficile infection or Norovirus. Patient Transport 1. Limit transport to essential purposes only. 2. Notify the receiving department, in advance, of the need for Contact Precautions . 3. The patient does not need to wear protective attire but should perform or be assisted in performing hand hygiene prior to leaving the room . 4. Wear clean gown and gloves for transport; remove upon reaching the destination, followed by hand hygiene. Refer to Infection Control Reference Tool: Transporting a Patient on Precautions for more information. Equipment 1. Dedicate the use of reusable patient care equipment (i.e., stethoscope, blood pressure cuff, etc.) when possible. If use of common equipment is unavoidable, then adequately clean and disinfect before use on another patient. Activity Room 1. Patients on Contact Precautions may not use the Activity Room or other common areas on the unit (e.g., the kitchen). If special circumstances arise (e.g., lengthy hospital stay) the Primary Nurse, Child Life Specialist, and Infection Control assess the situation and make accommodations to meet the patient's needs whenever possible. Siblings and other visiting children may not use the Activity Room. Parents and visitors 1. Parents and visitors pose little risk for transmission of infection because they are not involved in the direct care of other patients. Therefore, they do not need to wear gown and gloves. However, they should be aware of the need for precautions and how they are implemented. 2. Parents and visitors should be instructed and encouraged to practice diligent hand washing or hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand sanitizer while visiting and always before leaving the room and hospital. 3. Parents and visitors should limit their activities outside of the patient's room and visitation with other patients is prohibited. 4. Siblings and other visiting children may not use the Activity Room, or other common areas (e.g., kitchen). 5. For more information, see Infection Control Reference Tool: Isolation Precautions for Selected Infections and Conditions Routine and Terminal Cleaning 1. Routine cleaning and disinfecting procedures are the same for all inpatient rooms, regardless of precaution status, except for those designated for detailed discharge cleaning, e.g., rooms of patients on Contact Precautions for Clostridium difficile , MRSA, or VRE. All horizontal surfaces, including bedside equipment (bed rails, bedside tables, carts, commodes, faucet handles, etc.) are cleaned and disinfected with a hospital-approved disinfectant at least daily and whenever visibly soiled. Walls, blinds, ceilings, and curtains are cleaned according to an established schedule and whenever visibly soiled.

What are the types of evidencebased psychotherapies that OPS clinicians provide and in what delivery options are they available,0,"Entry into the OPS begins with a diagnostic evaluation , which is a comprehensive assessment of emotional and behavioral problems. This evaluation is designed to understand a patient's mental health. Following this evaluation, the clinician will summarize their evaluation findings and provide treatment recommendations to the family. Recommended treatment may be provided through the OPS or elsewhere. When indicated, OPS clinicians provide evidence-based psychotherapies (e.g., CBT, PCIT as well as individual and group delivery options) and/or psychopharmacology . These services are delivered both in-person as well as virtually pending an agreement with patients/families. OPS clinicians provide collaborative behavioral health care services using consultative and/or co- management care models (e.g., MCPAP) with primary care pediatric and specialty pediatric care providers as well as community behavioral clinicians as indicated. Some problems require long-term care and whenever feasible, once a patient has been stabilized, the OPS clinician works with behavioral health clinicians or primary care practitioners in the community who can assume the care of a patient.","The Outpatient Psychiatry Service (OPS) offers comprehensive mental health evaluations and treatment for a wide range of conditions that affect the mental, emotional and social health of children and adolescents. New patients receive a diagnostic evaluation and specific treatment recommendations tailored to the child and family. The OPS includes experienced clinicians, clinical researchers, and innovative educators in the fields of child psychology, clinical social work, and child and adolescent psychiatry. A majority of clinicians actively provide teaching and supervision to our psychology, psychiatry, and social worker trainees, resulting in carefully considered assessment and care plans for our patients.","The following template language may be used by investigators for various scenarios. Since each protocol is different, it is impossible to provide templates for each possibility. It is the investigator's responsibility to determine which issues apply to their research and to include the appropriate information in the consent document. Investigators should adapt this template language as deemed necessary. 1. Incidental Findings When Scans Images Performed only for Research When imaging subjects there is always the risk of discovering a potential abnormality. We emphasize that the (insert type of image/ scan) being performed for this study are designed to answer specific research questions and they are not designed to be used for any medical diagnoses of conditions that may or may not exist. The research images, as such, are not substitutes for what a doctor would order and so may not show problems that might be picked up by clinically indicated medical images. Your research images will, however, be examined by a trained radiologist or clinician within one week of the exam. If the radiologist/ clinician believes that the research study may show an unexpected abnormality, he/she may request that you return for additional imaging or recommend that you contact your physician for further follow-up. Information generated from the research imaging will become part of your medical record. It is possible that by participating in this research study you could become unnecessarily worried if an abnormality was suspected but later ruled out by further tests. 2. Incidental Findings When More Frequent or Additional Scans/Images Performed only Subjects who are patients at Boston Children's. When imaging subjects there is always the risk of discovering a potential abnormality. We emphasize that the (insert type of image) being performed for this study are designed to answer specific research questions. The research images, as such, are not substitutes for what a doctor would order and so may not show problems that might be picked up by clinically indicated medical/imaging. However, because there are more frequent (or additional) images being performed than would be routinely required for your care, they still will, be examined by a trained radiologist/clinician within one week of the exam. If the radiologist/clinician believes that the research study may show an unexpected abnormality, he/she may request that you return for additional imaging or recommend that you contact your physician for further follow-up. Information generated from the research/imaging will become part of your medical record. It is possible that by participating in this research study you could become unnecessarily worried if an abnormality was suspected but later ruled out by further tests. 3. What will happen with the information obtained as part of this research study? What about confidentiality? In order to perform imaging for this research, you/your child will need to have an appointment scheduled through the hospital systems. If you are already a patient at the hospital your information is already on file. However, if you are not a current Boston Children's Hospital patient, the hospital is required to obtain certain types of information in the event it was ever required for your care. You will be asked for insurance /third party payer information even if the research will cover the costs of these tests. In addition, you will be asked for the name of your primary care provider. You may decide whether or not to provide your primary care providers name. If you do provide this information a report about imaging will be sent to the provider. Medical information collected during this study will become part of your/your child's hospital record. Medical records are considered permanent records. Therefore, materials cannot be deleted from the record. Medical records are available to health care professionals at Boston Children's Hospital and may be reviewed by Hospital staff in the course of carrying out their responsibilities. However, they are required to maintain confidentiality in accordance with applicable laws and Hospital policies. Information contained in your/your child's medical record may not be given to anyone unaffiliated with Boston Children's Hospital in a way that could identify you/your child without written consent, except as required or permitted by law. Information collected during the study that does not become part of your/your child's medical record will be stored in separate research files maintained by the investigator. If you/your child withdraw from the research study, information that has already been collected will become part of the research data. However, you/your child will not be identified.","The IRB requires investigators to identify the amounts and types of payments offered to research subjects. Investigators are encouraged to consider what on average is reasonable. 1. Reimbursement 2. Compensation 3. Tokens of appreciation 4. Incentives: Incentives are generally discouraged in pediatric research; however, the IRB will consider whether an incentive unduly influences a child and/or family to participate when reviewing and approving this type of payment. Any bonus payment for completion of the trial must be reasonable and not so large as to induce participants to stay in the trial. In addition to approving specific amounts and types of payments, the IRB may also require changes in the amount and/or type. Any change or modification to approved amounts and/or types of payment must be submitted to the IRB as an amendment.","1.

Reports are kept in the SERS database","Adverse Event: harm to a patient resulting from care and treatment, not due to the underlying condition of the patient. For purposes of this definition, we also include errors that reach the patient but do not cause harm. An adverse event, after an internal review by the Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) Program for Patient Safety and Quality, may be further categorized as a ""serious reportable event"" or ""serious incident or accident report"" as defined by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health; a ""sentinel event"" as defined by The Joint Commission; or a ""never event"" as defined by the National Quality Forum. Near Miss Event: Any event or situation that if left undetected or uncorrected may have the potential to cause harm, but did not reach the patient. Adverse Drug Event (ADE): A subset of adverse events that includes medication errors, adverse drug reactions, and drug incompatibilities. Medications include all prescription drug preparations, over the counter (OTC) products, and IV fluids. ADEs encompass harm, or events that require interventions to prevent harm, that result from the use of medications, controlled substances, or pharmaceutical/drug preparation that occur on the hospital premises or are otherwise identified during a patient encounter. ADEs also include adverse drug reaction (ADR), as defined by The National Institute of Health, as a response to a drug that is noxious and unintended, and that occurs at doses used in humans for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or treatment of disease, or for the modification of physiologic function. Apparent Cause Analysis (ACA): A limited investigation of an event performed for selected adverse events that is considered peer review protected information that does not require a full RCA (e.g., Precursor or Near- Miss events). Root Cause Analysis (RCA): A comprehensive, systematic analysis that is performed to identify the causal and contributory factors as well as appropriate corrective actions to prevent a recurrence. The RCA (including internal discussions, analysis, and corrective actions related to clinicians) is considered peer review protected information that is approved by the Senior Clinical Leadership Committee (SCLC). Safety Event Reporting System (SERS): The hospital's electronic data collection repository used for reporting, reviewing, and documenting analysis of events. This includes, but is not limited to, any occurrence of an adverse event, any near miss event, an event or situation that places a patient at increased risk of harm, or unplanned significant change in medical or surgical management not related to the patient's underlying condition. The SERS is a peer review protected system in which any event (including but not limited to adverse events, potential adverse events, and near miss adverse events) are recorded for internal investigation and quality improvement activities. Events reported through SERS are reviewed and classified by the staff of the Program for Patient Safety and Quality (PPSQ) according to definitions and guidelines described in the SERS User Manual. PPSQ determines the classification and preventability of adverse events in collaboration with the local SERS Manager and others within BCH. See Appendix A for further information on adverse event classification. Information in the SERS system is privileged and peer review protected.

Research approved at a convened IRB meeting or through expedited review prior to January 21, 2019 and all FDA regulated research will undergo continuing review. 2. Protocols originally approved at a convened IRB meeting may undergo expedited continuing review: a. When: i. The research is permanently closed to the enrollment of new subjects and ii. All the subjects have completed all research-related interventions; and iii. The research remains active only for long term follow-up of subjects; or b. Where no subjects have been enrolled and no additional risks have been identified; or c. Where remaining research activities are limited to data analysis 3. Continuing review may be conducted through expedited procedures, if: a. It is non-FDA regulated research, (not conducted under investigational new drug application or investigational device exemption), and b. Where the permitted expedited categories do not apply, but the IRB has determined and documented at a convened meeting that the research i. Involves no greater than minimal risk a nd ii. No additional risks have been identified. 4. Review will be conducted at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less than once per year. Time Interval Upon initial review of a protocol, the IRB determines the time interval for the next continuing review. Review must occur within 1-year of the last approval date for a protocol to remain active; however, the IRB may decide more frequent review is necessary. 1. Convened IRB : For a protocol reviewed by the convened IRB, continuing review must occur within 1 year of the protocol being approved at a convened IRB meeting. 2. Expedited Review : For a protocol approved under expedited review that still requires Continuing Review, the review must occur within 1 year of the date the IRB Chair or designated IRB member(s) provide initial approval. More Frequent Review More frequent review may be based on a specific time interval or on a requirement to report back after a specified number of participants have been studied. In making the determination that more frequent review is required, the IRB takes into consideration: 1. The risk of the protocol and 2. The type of information the IRB would like to receive in order to assure appropriate oversight on an ongoing basis. Criteria used to consider whether more frequent review is required includes the following : 1. High-risk protocols where there is concern about significant adverse events that may be permanent, irreversible, or disabling, or that may significantly compromise the research subject. 2. Protocols where the potential risks are completely unknown, unless the minutes document that approval is granted for 1 year. 3. Protocols that involve newborns that include conditions for which it is not possible to perform studies in older children. 4. Protocols submitted with data from preliminary studies that raise concern regarding the possibility of serious adverse events. If more frequent review is required, the investigator will be informed through the approval notification and the CHeRP system will be set to notify the investigator at the required time. At the time of continuing review, the convened IRB or expedited reviewer will assure that all criteria for approval of research continue to be met. Review Tracking The IRB administrative office is responsible for tracking continuing reviews and for notifying investigators when review is required. The Continuing Review SmartForm must be submitted and approved prior to the protocol's expiration date. Principal Investigators (PIs) must submit the continuing review with ample time for the IRB to address any needed questions and revisions. 1. Three months before the protocol's expiration, the CHeRP system will send an automated notice to the PI and research team. 2. If the continuing review is not received, then a. A second notice will be sent at 2 months before the expiration date. b. A third notice will be sent 1 month before the expiration date. Continuing Review: Expedited and Convened IRB Review Process Expedited Review Continuing reviews which qualify for expedited review may be reviewed through the expedited review procedures. Convened IRB All continuing reviews which do not qualify for expedited review are placed on the agenda for the convened IRB meeting. The IRB will use the same criteria and take the same actions described in the IRB policy, 1. One IRB reviewer is assigned to each continuing review. 2. No member with a conflict of interest may serve as a reviewer. 3. All members can access the continuing review submission via CHeRP. Through CHeRP, IRB members have electronic access to the complete IRB protocol file and relevant IRB minutes, including amendments/modifications, unanticipated problems, and previous continuing review approvals. 4. The Continuing Review SmartForm includes: a. The number of subjects accrued: i. Enrolled (signed consent form) ii. Withdrawn due to subject request iii. Withdrawn due to toxicity/adverse events iv. Lost to follow-up v. Completed study (without events leading to early termination) vi. Currently active on study vii. Other category b. Removed for ineligibility c. A summary of adverse events and any unanticipated problems that involve risks to subjects or others, and any withdrawal of subjects from the research or complaints about the research since the last IRB review. d. If applicable: i. A summary of any relevant recent literature and interim findings. ii. Data and safety monitoring reports may be submitted. iii. Any relevant multi-center trial reports. iv. Monitoring reports from sponsors. e. Any other relevant information, particularly information about risks associated with the research. f. Links to the currently approved protocol, recruitment documents, and informed consent documents. g. Information regarding reliance arrangements 5. IRB members are provided with a continuing review Reviewer Worksheet to complete. When reviewing the current informed consent document, the IRB ensures that : a. The currently approved or proposed consent document is still accurate and complete; and b. Any significant new findings that may relate to the subject's willingness to continue to participate are provided to the subject. 6. The IRB may request and rely on a current statement from the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) or the sponsor that indicates it has reviewed study-wide adverse events, interim findings, and any recent literature that may be relevant to the research, in lieu of requiring that this information be submitted directly to the IRB. 7. In general, when taking an action of conditional approval at the time of continuing review, any noted conditions need to be satisfied before an investigator may continue research activities related to the conditions specified. a. During the continuing review, the IRB may make determinations that currently enrolled subjects may continue, but no new subjects may be enrolled until a designated IRB member reviews a revised protocol and verifies that conditions are met. 8. After the convened IRB meeting, the investigator is sent notification of the action taken. a. When approved, the informed consent dates are modified to reflect the new period of approval and expiration.","The IRB calculates the date of initial IRB approval in the following manner: 1. Convened IRB Reviewed Study a. When a research study is approved at a convened IRB meeting, the date of the convened IRB meeting is the approval date. b. When the research study is conditionally approved at a convened IRB meeting, the date of the IRB approval remains the date the study was conditionally approved at a convened IRB meeting. The date the designated IRB reviewer determines that the research protocol has satisfied all conditions required, reflected in the CHeRP action ""Research Team Response Adequate"". 2. Expedited Study: When a research study is reviewed and approved through an expedited review process, the date the expedited reviewer approves the research is approval date.","Procedures provides detailed procedural requirements, step, methods and guidance on how covered persons are expected to perform recognizing every case and patient are different [in accordance with the policy]. 1. Example a. Example The IRB is to ensure that the following conditions are met: Subpart Applies Where any Subject is or Becomes a Prisoner The provisions of Subpart apply to any research funded by Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that involves prisoners as subjects. This includes situations in which a human subject: 1. Is a prisoner when they are enrolled in the research; or 2. Becomes a prisoner after the research commences. Special Composition of IRB and Reviewers Required for Convened IRB and Expedited Reviews The IRB must meet the special composition requirement for the convened IRB review of new protocols, continuing reviews, and protocol amendments: 1. A designated prisoner representative must be present as a voting IRB member at all convened IRB meetings at which protocols that involve prisoners are reviewed that involve HHS funding. a. This individual is to have the appropriate background and experience to serve in this capacity, including a close working knowledge of prison conditions and prison life. 2. In addition, most of the IRB (exclusive of prisoner members) will have no association with the prison involved, apart from their membership on the IRB. 3. The IRB prisoner representative will be assigned as a primary or secondary reviewer for all protocols, continuing reviews, and amendments that involve incarcerated youth/prisoners. When expedited review procedures are utilized, the prisoner representative must be assigned: all protocols, continuing reviews, and amendments for those protocols that involve prisoners and incarcerated. Other members may be assigned in addition to the prisoner representative. Single IRB Review If a protocol is to be reviewed by more than one IRB, only one of the reviewing IRBs must meet this requirement.","Voting Actions Approval: When an acceptable risk/benefit ratio exists, and the protocol is approved as submitted. 1. For research to be approved, it requires the approval of the majority of those members present at the meeting. Conditional Approval: When the IRB reviews and approves a research study (or proposed changes to a previously approved research study), the IRB requires as a condition of approval that the investigator: 1. Make specified changes to the research protocol or informed consent document(s), 2. Confirm specific assumptions or understandings on the part of the IRB regarding how the research will be conducted, or 3. Submit additional documents, such that, based on the assumption that the conditions are satisfied, the IRB is able to make all of the determinations required for approval under the federal regulations. When the IRB members determine a protocol is conditionally approved, they also must decide if: 1. the response is sent back to the IRB member primary and secondary reviewers or 2. the IRB analysts (who are also IRB members) to confirm all changes and requests have been made. Deferral: When the changes proposed, or questions raised by the IRB prevent the IRB from making one or more of the determinations and specific changes required for approval by the regulations. Due to: 1. Lack of information or concerns raised in terms of risks and benefits 2. Adequacy of privacy and confidentiality protections 3. Adequacy of the informed consent process Examples of reasons for deferral include: 1. The protocol was poorly written, lacking significant amounts of information regarding scientific justification, procedures, and/or risk reduction. 2. There are significant ethical concerns that do not permit a favorable risk/benefit determination. 3. More information is required or changes in design and procedures must be implemented. 4. There are clarifications and modifications requested directly relevant to determinations required by the regulations such as the data and safety monitoring plan. All responses to deferrals are placed back before the convened IRB for review. Disapproval : When after consultation with the investigator, the IRB determines that the research presents subject risks far outweigh the benefit or value of the knowledge to be gained; or the research raises such serious ethical questions as to be unacceptable. In the event disapproval is foreseen, the investigator is invited to attend the meeting to discuss the protocol. Voting Documentation 1. At the convened IRB meeting, a vote is taken and recorded. 2. The total number of votes is always equal to the total number of members present at the meeting. 3. Minority Reporting: Those members who vote against a majority action on a research protocol is encouraged and is noted within the minutes.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

What should the clinical team do if a patient or family objects to the use of blood or blood products for religious or other reasons,1,"• Blood and blood products may include one or more of the following: whole blood, red blood cells, platelets, plasma, and/or cryoprecipitate. • Within the informed consent, the patient and/or the parent/guardian is authorizing the administration of blood or blood components for the duration of the hospital stay (from the time the procedure/treatment begins through the time the patient is discharged). Blood may be provided for any reason during the hospital stay, so long as the overall hospital stay is related to the subject of the informed consent. • If the patient has not consented to the use of blood or blood products as part of the informed consent form, a separate informed consent is required for any patient requiring transfusion of a blood component following the procedure, using the BCH Blood Transfusion Consent form. ◦ For patients who object for religious or other reasons, please note that the clinical team should discuss the various blood alternatives that may be acceptable. If there continues to be concerns from the patient or the family and it is necessary to provide blood or blood products, consider contacting the BCH attorney on call to consider legal action to obtain authorization. • Patients should be aware that all blood and blood products that are used from a donor are tested by BCH. However, Blood provided by the patient in advance of their own procedure is not tested for transmissible diseases, if it is donated here at BCH.","Jehovah's Witnesses believe blood represents life and is sacred to God. Blood leaving the body must be disposed of and not transfused. Patients and/or families of the Jehovah's Witness faith generally do not allow for the use of blood products. They do allow for the transfusion of some derivatives of blood such as albumin. The cardiac surgeon will discuss the options with the family. A court order may be acquired which gives the clinical team legal protection if the physicians determine it is in the patient's best interest to use blood products. In an effort to avoid blood product usage, and respect our patient's wishes, consideration should be given to the following","• The use of blood products in the extracorporeal circuit is dictated by patient need, physician consultation and policy guidelines. • The use of other blood products, such as plasma and platelets (rarely) in the bypass circuit is dictated by the attending surgeon and/or anesthesiologist. • Refer to guidelines Bypass Prime Selection (2.6), Priming the Perfusion Circuit (2.7) and Cell Saver Washing of Blood for Bypass Primes (2.14) for additional information. • Conventional and zero balance ultrafiltration must be considered when administering bank blood and to control the electrolytes and lactate level in the patient's circulating blood volume. • All blood products are irradiated (PRBCs are also leukoreduced) before they are sent to the CVOR. This is an important consideration in the prevention of graft versus host disease and significant morbidity or even mortality. While this practice leads to potassium leak from the cells, it is generally considered acceptable to do this up to 18 hours in advance. Our Blood Bank practice typically has irradiation done <6 hours before dispense and so the potassium increase should be minimal (1). • There is a laminated Suspected Transfusion Reaction guidance document hanging on every anesthesia machine. The Blood Bank must be notified (5-6260 or 5-4166, or pager 6260) if a transfusion reaction is suspected so that a Blood Bank physician can advise on next steps. • Refer to PolicyStat document, Transfusion of Blood or Blood Components, for information regarding product verification and transfusion practice. • Recommendations for minimum acceptable hematocrit levels for different patient populations are listed in the chart below.","1. If blood is transfusing from external hospital upon arrival to BCH, the blood may continue to transfuse. 2. Patients transferred to BCH for a procedure and intend to return to their hospital of origin may use external hospital blood products. a. Check cooler expiration time and temperature. b. Check blood against outside hospital ID. c. If blood is transfused, keep transfusion tag with patient's BCH record. d. Return all unused blood products, used blood bags and cooler to the hospital of origin. 3. If the patient is admitted to BCH: a. Obtain a BCH type and screen for anticipated need of blood products if needed. b. If an immediate transfusion is necessary and BCH blood products are not available, external blood products may be transfused (follow steps outlined in #2 for checking blood). c. Return all unused external blood products and cooler to hospital of origin on foot by clinical assistant to BWH or via currier to BIDMC Blood Bank. d. Unused blood products cannot be transferred or infusing when patient is admitted to other areas of BCH. 4.

Earned Time will be deducted from an Employee's accrued Earned Time bank as follows: ◦ For Non-Exempt Employees , Earned Time will be deducted for the number of hours the Employee would otherwise be regularly scheduled to work on the Observed Holiday. For Employees who have insufficient Earned Time to cover the Observed Holiday, Earned Time will be deducted for the number of hours the Employee would otherwise be regularly scheduled to work on the Observed Holiday up to the amount of the available Earned Time balance. ◦ For Exempt Plus Employees , Earned Time will be deducted for the number of hours of the Employee would otherwise be regularly scheduled to work on the Observed Holiday. Employees who have insufficient Earned Time to cover the Observed Holiday will be unpaid for the full day, unless they have received approval to work on the Observed Holiday. ◦ For Exempt Employees , for Full-Time employees (1.0 FTE), 8 hours of Earned Time will be deducted for any Observed Holiday occurring on a weekday. For Employees with less than a 1.0 FTE, Earned Time will be deducted on a pro rata daily basis for any Observed Holiday occurring on a weekday. If the Observed Holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday, no Earned Time is deducted. ◦ If the Observed Holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday, no Earned Time is deducted from any employee's Earned Time bank for Saturday or Sunday, unless the employee is regularly scheduled to work on Saturday or Sunday. ◦ When New Year's Day, Independence Day or Christmas Day fall on a Saturday or Sunday, Earned Time will be deducted for the Friday or Monday weekday observance. • Employees may combine working time and Earned Time on an Observed Holiday up to the total number of hours the Employee would otherwise be regularly scheduled to work on the Observed Holiday.","• Non-Exempt Employees are eligible for Holiday Pay for all time worked on an Observed Holiday. Holiday Pay is paid at a rate of one-and-a-half times the Non-Exempt Employee's base hourly rate. • Exempt Plus Employees are eligible for Holiday Pay as a premium when working a shift on an Observed Holiday. Holiday Pay is paid for all hours in the shift at 50% of the Employee's Base Hourly Rate Equivalent and is in addition to the Employee's regular base salary. • When New Year's Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day or Christmas Day, fall on a Saturday or Sunday and BCH observes the Holiday on a Friday or a Monday.

Shift differential is included in ET taken for all employees in a job code eligible for shift differential pay. When shift differential is included in ET, the amount of shift differential will be calculated by using the weighted hourly average of total evening, night and/or weekend shift differential pay earned in the previous pay period. The weighted average is the total of all shift differential paid during the previous pay period divided by the total number of hours worked in the previous pay period. • When ET is used for illnesses, emergencies and other unanticipated time off, including partial day absences, it is recorded as Unscheduled ET (ETU). Unscheduled ET should be recorded for both full and partial day absences. • All uses for ET other than ETU should be recorded as Scheduled ET (ETS). • ETS must be approved in advance by the employee's manager in accordance with the requirements of the employee's department. Employees and managers should work together to balance an employee's need for time off with the coverage and operational needs of the department. • For Exempt employees, when the employee has worked the majority of a shift or workday and the missed work time is minimal, ET is not required to be used to cover missed work time. • ETS may be used for variances that exist between an Employee's regularly scheduled weekly hours and their actual hours worked in a week. • Employees must accurately record in Kronos all ETS and ETU taken during the pay period. Employees who fail to record their time accurately in Kronos will be subject to disciplinary action. • Employees are generally expected to take 8 hours of ET for full day absences. Employees who work a shift schedule that is different than 8 hours will have their regularly scheduled shift's equivalent amount of ET deducted for a full day's absence. • Employees may not take unpaid time off, except in the following circumstances: ◦ The employee has no ET in the employee's ET bank and the employee's manager has approved the time off in advance; ◦ the time off is covered by the Family Medical Leave Act and/or the Massachusetts Paid Family and Medical Leave Act policies (during which period, the employee may receive partial income supplementation from the state); or ◦ as may be required by law • Available ET may not be used to supplement Massachusetts Paid Family and Medical Leave Act (MAPFML) benefits or short-term disability benefits while receiving MAPFML benefits. Available ET may be used in lieu of MAPFML benefits, and if so, may also be used to supplement short-term disability benefits. If an employee elects to forego the state MAPFML benefit and use ET, Boston Children's short- term disability benefit will be calculated as if the employee was receiving the state MAPFML benefit Total payments, including ET and short-term disability benefits, cannot exceed the combined total of the employee's tax adjusted regular base salary.","• Consistent with the FLSA and state law, Exempt and Exempt Plus employees are paid on a salary basis (except for those positions not covered by the salary basis regulations).

The DYS worker determines if hospital security is needed. ◦ If for any reason the handcuffs or shackles are removed for clinical interventions, the DYS worker remains in the room. The DYS worker is respectful of privacy and will turn away from the patient while intervention is being performed. • Patient communications ◦ DYS patients are not allowed to make phone calls. The DYS worker is responsible for making sure the patient doesn't have a cell phone. ◦ Follow up appointments should not be discussed with the patient but rather given to the DYS worker. ◦ BCH legal does not need to be contacted for notification that a patient is here in shackles unless there is need for legal guidance • Nursing Responsibility ◦ The RN discusses the best approach to meeting ADL needs of the patient with the DYS worker. ◦ The RN assesses for signs of skin breakdown and performs all other care as indicated and documents according to policy.","For a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD) to be used in treatment, diagnosis, or research: 1. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the FDA must approve it and 2. A Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) must be issued by the FDA. While the effectiveness of the device does not have to be demonstrated, the IRB will consider: 1. The HDE brochure and 2. The information provided about risks and benefits. The initial review of a HUD is to be completed by the convened IRB. 1. The IRB approval must verify that the use of the HUD, as proposed, is consistent with current labeling of the device and does not exceed the scope of the FDA approved indication. a. The device's labeling must state that the device is a HUD and that, although the device is authorized by Federal Law, the effectiveness of the device for the specific indication has not been proven or demonstrated. The investigator using the HUD must use the HUD only in accordance with the labeling of the device, intended purpose, and in the designated population for which the FDA approved its use. If the investigator plans to collect data for a new use of the device, then the Investigational New Device (IDE) regulations must be followed. The IRB may approve use of the HUD without any further restrictions, or under a protocol, or on a case-by- case basis. Informed Consent The IRB requires that documented informed consent is obtained from a patient prior to the use of a HUD. 1. The consent is to describe the status of the device and the intended use. 2. If an investigator proposes to collect prospective data when the device is used, this data collection should be addressed in the consent. 3. The consent also needs to indicate that the effectiveness of the device for a specific indication has not been demonstrated. 4. The document should not use the term ""research"" to refer to the use of the device. 5. It is also suggested that the investigator provide the HUD brochure (prepared by the manufacturer, if available) to the patient, and review it with the patient prior to use. Continuing Review IRB Continuing Review is required and may occur using expedited procedures. At the time of continuing review, the investigator must report the HUD activities for the previous year. Unanticipated Event Reporting Adverse events and unanticipated problems that results from the use of a humanitarian device are subject to ""Unanticipated Problem"" reporting requirements. 1. FDA regulations require that if a physician or health care provider receives or otherwise becomes aware of information, from any source, that reasonably suggests that a HUD has or may have caused or contributed to the death or serious injury of a patient, the physician or health care provider must report such findings to the FDA as soon as possible, but no later than 10 working days after the Investigator first learns of the effect or problem. 2.

This includes: • Preparing for treatment/plasma volume calculation • Providing the treatment • Contraindications • Side effects Contraindications The Liposorber LA-15 must not be used with the following: 1. Patients who are being treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors; Severe anaphylactic reactions including shock have been observed in patients treated with the LIPOSORBER ® LA-15 LDL Adsorption Column under concomitant ACE inhibitor medication. Temporary suspension of ACE inhibitors is not sufficient to avoid severe reactions. 2. Patients with coagulation disorders such as severe hemophilia, severe hemorrhage diathesis, severe gastrointestinal ulcers, or who are receiving vitamin K antagonist medications after surgery 3. Patients who cannot tolerate extracorporeal volume shifts such as those with severe cardiac insufficiency, acute myocardial infarction, severe cardiac arrhythmia, acute apoplexy, or severe uncontrollable hypertension or hypotension 4. Patients with hypersensitivity to dextran sulfate cellulose, heparin or ethylene oxide. Side Effects • Hypotension • Nausea • Vomiting • Flushing • Angina • Fainting • Venous Access Problems Calculating plasma volume for FSGS patients 1. Determine plasma volume to be treated as follows 60mL/kg: STEP 1: a. Obtain patient weight in kilograms b. Multiply patient weight by 60 c. Round up value to the nearest hundredth. This is the plasma volume to be treated. EXAMPLE: 51kg x 60= 3060= 3100mLs","Patient Referral 1. Patient's Primary Service to consult with Transfusion Medicine Physician Team to obtain approval 2. Confirm angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are not being used by the patient. 3.

Severe anaphylactic reactions, including shock, have been observed in patients treated with the LIPOSORBER ® LA-15 LDL Adsorption Column under concomitant ACE inhibitor medication. Temporary ceasing of ACE inhibitor intake to remove its bioactivity from the patient's blood may not always be sufficient to avoid such adverse reactions. The ACE inhibitors should be switched to another antihypertensive medication at the treating physician's discretion. ACE inhibitors are contraindicated with Liposorber LA-15 Treatment for LDL Apheresis. 5. Adequate venous access must be in place before initiating treatment. 6. Venous access options should be discussed with the TAU Clinical team during the initial consult. A vein assessment should be performed if appropriate.","• Kaneka Liposorber MA-03 – including the MA-03 Apheresis Tubing System for Plasmapheresis (NK- M3R(U)) • Sulflux KP-05 Plasma Separator • Liposorber LA-15 LDL Adsorption Columns x 2 • 20 ml syringe • Waste Bag(s) • 3 ml syringe with needle • Heparin Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (10 ml, 1000 u/ml) X 2 • 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (1000 ml) X 4 • Ringer Lactated Injection, USP (1000 ml) X 4-6 • 5% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (500 ml) X 2 • Albumin 5% (1000 mls) with Heparin 3,000 units (as needed for circuit prime) • Labels for heparin syringe and priming solution • 16GA x 1'' High Flow Noncoring Needle X 2 • Chloraprep • Plastic hemostats • 17G Fistula Needle • 18G Angiocatheter","1.

In cases of suspected child abuse who should the nurses contact according to the hospital policy,0,"1. Massachusetts General Laws, Ch. 119, Section 51 A, mandates that healthcare providers (defined to include, but not be limited to, physicians (including interns, residents, and fellows), emergency medical technicians, dentists, nurses, chiropractors, podiatrists, optometrists, osteopaths, social workers, psychiatrists, psychologists, and drug and alcoholism counselors) who interact with children and families report all suspected abuse and neglect to the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families (DCF) which receives, screens, and investigates such reports. 2. The law requires a report to the Massachusetts DCF (or its equivalent in other states) when a mandated reporter in his/her professional capacity has reasonable cause to believe that a child under the age of 18 is suffering a physical or emotional injury including those resulting from: a. Abuse inflicted upon him/her including sexual abuse; b. Neglect, including malnutrition; or c. Physical dependence on an addictive drug at birth. 3. According to state law, a mandated reporter will not be held liable for civil or criminal action because of a report to DCF that is made in good faith. 4. All patients ages 4 and up who present to an ambulatory setting, the Emergency Department or are admitted must be screened for abuse and neglect. Abuse and neglect are screened using the question "" Do you feel safe at home? "" if: a. The question can be asked apart from the parent or caregiver, and b. The patient is medically and behaviorally able to answer: i. If patient responds yes and no additional risk indicators are apparent, no further action is required. ii. If the patient responds no and/or additional risk indicators are apparent contact Social Work. iii. If patients are unable to answer the screening question and if additional risk indicators are apparent contact Social Work. iv. For patients that are under the age of 4 or are developmentally or clinically unable to answer the screening question, an assessment of clinical indicators of potential maltreatment will be conducted. 5. Healthcare Providers are also mandated reporters if they encounter suspected abuse and/or neglect of an elderly individual or a disabled person, as outlined in this policy. 6. Components 7. The following components of care are implemented to assist staff in responding to child maltreatment concerns for a child(ren) being treated at a Boston Children's Hospital location: a. Screen : A screen is done on all patients at all encounters to help understand if there is suspected abuse and neglect. b. Observe: For clinical indicators if screening is not possible. c. Assess: Performed if triggers are apparent indicating suspected abuse or neglect. d. Identify: The hospital creates and maintains a proactive approach to identify events and occurrences that may constitute or contribute to abuse and neglect by using the Safety Event Reporting System (SERS) and the Child Protection Team (CPT). e. Train: Boston Children's provides training during the orientation of all employees and through annual ongoing education. The education provides all employees with information related to indicators and appropriate response to child maltreatment including mandated reporting. f. Protect: The hospital must act to ensure the safety and well-being of patients suspected of being maltreated while they are undergoing evaluation and treatment at the hospital for any condition. The clinicians involved in the care of a patient communicate their concerns to one another in order to assure medical and psychosocial assessment of the child, inclusive of maltreatment concerns. If there is an allegation of suspected maltreatment of any kind, the hospital's Department of Social Work ensures that a social worker can complete a psychosocial assessment when clinically indicated. g. In the case of an employee the manager considers reassigning the employee or removing them from all direct care responsibilities. Security, care companion or other human resources may be consulted for assistance regarding the management and concerns for risk. In cases of suspected maltreatment of a patient by a staff person the full range of disciplinary actions under Hospital policy may apply up to and including: termination of employment, termination of medical staff privileges and termination of computer privileges, or other sanctions as Boston Children's deems appropriate under the circumstances. h. Investigate: The hospital will ensure that mandated reports are filed with the appropriate State agency given the State's obligation to investigate maltreatment reports. The hospital ensures, in a timely and thorough manner, objective investigation of all allegations of abuse, neglect or maltreatment involving hospital staff while adhering to mandated reporting statutes. i. Report/Respond: The hospital must assure that any incidents of abuse, neglect or harassment are reported and analyzed and the appropriate corrective remedial or disciplinary action occurs in accordance with applicable local, state or Federal law.","• Screen all patients ages 4 and up who present to Ambulatory Clinics, the Emergency department, or who are admitted if medically and behaviorally able to answer and if the question ( Do you feel safe at home? ) can be asked apart from parent or caregiver. For patients that are under the age of 4 or are developmentally or clinically unable to answer the screening question, a clinical assessment of clinical indicators of potential maltreatment will be conducted. • Using the indicators above , the clinician screens for abuse on initial assessment. Any staff person who suspects child abuse or neglect contacts their team/unit/program social worker and notifies the appropriate supervisor for their department. • All staff who suspect child maltreatment are encouraged to notify and/or consult with CPT on any suspected child maltreatment case by contacting the Boston Children's page operator at 617-355-6369 or by utilizing the on-line paging system and referencing the Child Protection Team daily or monthly schedule. CPT consultants are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. • CPT consultants guide Boston Children's clinicians and staff through the process of determining whether the threshold has been met for filing a mandated report on behalf of a child with the state child welfare agency and the administrative requirements for filing the 51A paperwork when the clinician has reasonable cause to believe that the child is or has been abused and/or neglected that may require further response by DCF. In such circumstances, BCH will take action up to an including requesting an emergency response from DCF. • After a mandated report is filed, the state child welfare agency may call upon Boston Children's clinicians and staff to provide information about the patient and family. • Child welfare investigators may attend meetings with the team to be briefed on all the concerns that have emerged during Boston Children's involvement with the patient and family and to discuss necessary interventions to affect a safe discharge of the child home. • In some cases, a state child welfare agency may assume custody of the patient. The child welfare agency may request collaboration with Boston Children's staff to expedite this transition into the state's care, including teaching and orientation of alternative caregivers to the child's unique medical needs.","• The Hospital will not tolerate any act of violence, including physical, verbal, or sexual abuse, threats, and/ or harassment committed by anyone . • The Hospital will not tolerate any act of property damage or destruction. • Allegations, threats, or incidents of violence and/or abuse are serious and must be promptly reported to Security and your manager/supervisor. • In any violent or potentially violent situation involving a child, as long as the child is on-site, staff are responsible for taking necessary actions to protect the child from any further exposure to violence or abuse. Covered Personnel are responsible for reporting event to Security and Child Prevention Team in order to protect the child from any further exposure to violence or abuse and to protect the child. • For those Covered Personnel who are also Mandatory Reporters within the definition of M.G.L. c. 51A a report to authorities must also be made when appropriate. • Covered Personnel who violate this policy are subject to the full range of disciplinary action under Hospital policy, up to and including termination. See Human Resources Manual: Discipline Policy and Standards of Conduct for additional information.","Identification of Child Abuse/Neglect Clinicians who interact directly with patients and families may be the first to identify conditions or circumstances that may be indicative of abuse or neglect. CPT provides training and consultation to assist clinical staff in expanding their knowledge base with regard to the identification of suspected child maltreatment. The list below, while not comprehensive, enumerates several conditions or symptoms that may be indicative of child maltreatment. Using the indicators below the clinician screens for abuse on initial assessment of the patient if clinically indicated.","A. Staff members are obligated to report known or suspected cases of patient abuse, neglect, or exploitation. When required by law and regulation, these cases must be reported to the appropriate State agency. 1. Examples of urgent situations are: a. Suicide threats b. Child abuse c. Spousal abuse d. Elder abuse e. Drug and/or medical device recalls B. The burden of proof for abuse or neglect may be high. Employees should have reason to believe that abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred before reporting such. Boston Children’s Specialty Pharmacy will follow a consistent procedure when abuse or neglect is suspected: 1. Staff will report the suspected case to the Pharmacy Director of Safety and Quality. 2. The Pharmacy Director of Safety and Quality will seek to validate or denigrate the suspicion. 3. When the findings are corroborated, the state agency of Health and Human Services will be contacted, and the referral will be made. 4. All such actions and communications will be documented in the patient's record. C. Potential suicide calls: [URAC CPE 3-3] 1. In the event that an employee receives a telephone call from a caller who is threatening suicide or other harm to themselves or to other people, the employee will keep the caller on the line and signal to another employee for assistance in calling 988. 2. During the time that the employee has the caller on the line, the employee should remain calm and obtain as much information about the caller so it can be provided to the co-worker for notification to 988. 3. At no time after the call is received from a suicidal caller, will the employee answering the phone hang-up, transfer the call or put the caller on hold. 4. The employee who has answered the call will remain on the line until confirmation has been received that emergency personnel are on the scene. 5. Suicide National Suicide Prevention Lifeline phone number (800-273-8255) or 988 will be posted for reference in an easily accessible location near inbound phones. D. Serious Adverse Side Effects [URAC CPE 3-3] [URAC P-PSC 1-1] 1. In the event that a non-clinical employee receives a call from a patient that is experiencing a serious adverse side effect that employee will transfer to a pharmacist for counseling. 2. Patient’s calls that are directly answered by a pharmacist will be counseled immediately. 3. Pharmacist will make outreach to the patient’s prescriber, if necessary, to inform of the side effect and make recommendations.",4,4,0,0,4,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
What is the title of the document that provides a guide to onboarding nonBCH employed physicians,0,"Medical Staff hiring and onboarding at BCH is a multi-faceted process requiring careful coordination and the involvement of multiple departments. This Administrative Guide is designed to help administrative staff directly involved with the hiring and onboarding process navigate these processes. Administrative staff may be asked to assist with the hiring and onboarding of Medical Staff with different types of faculty appointments; Medical Staff with privileges at one or more hospitals and/or in one or more clinical departments; Medical Staff with research activities; Medical Staff who are moving from trainee status to the level of an Attending; Medical Staff who are employed by BCH; physicians who are employed by a Foundation; Medical Staff with immigration needs; and Medical Staff with a variety of other needs and circumstances that may be unique to the department or the individual. While no procedural document can anticipate every process or circumstance, this Administrative Guide outlines each of the major administrative processes that touch the hiring and onboarding of BCH employed Medical Staff. Users of this Administrative Guide should note a few important caveats: First, this Administrative Guide does not cover Medical Staff selection processes or criteria, nor does it address Medical Staff compensation. Second, this Guide does not cover administrative processes for House Staff (Interns, Residents and Clinical Fellows); please contact the Graduate Medical Education office or the Human Resources Service Center for questions about onboarding and orientation of House Staff if you need assistance with processes for House Staff. Third, this Guide does not cover administrative processes specifically related to Medical Staff employment by the Foundations. Please refer to the Administrative Guide to Onboarding Non-BCH Employed Medical Staff for administrative processes for Medical Staff employed by a Foundation. Lastly, administrative requirements change, as do processes and systems. BCH is doing a multi-phase upgrade of PeopleSoft and has recently implemented an electronic credentialing system. These changes, along with others that will happen as BCH grows and improves, may mean some variation. This Administrative Guide will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect changes in practice and process.","1.

The guideline recognizes that Boston Children's Hospital is a center for the diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases and possesses specialization in treatments and therapies unavailable at many medical centers. While Boston Children's Hospital has the treatment of pediatric patients as a core mission, through new and innovative therapies many more pediatric patients require care for pediatric disease extending into adulthood. Additionally, through Boston Children's Hospital's commitment to research and clinical innovation, the expertise, treatment, therapy, procedures and surgical care available at Boston Children's Hospital may not be available at an adult care facility. Accordingly, as a department, Radiology participates in the care of patients over the age of 21.

What equipment is typically used for transferring blood from the pump circuit to the cell saver,1,• Stopcock • Blood spike pin adapter • Male-male line typically used for transferring blood from the pump circuit to the cell saver,"• Bank blood is known to have nonphysiologic values for many electrolytes which can lead to an undesirable effect on hemodynamics once transfused (1-4). Cell saver washing of PRBC units has been shown to effectively control mediators of hemodynamic change seen with stored blood (2,5). Though, increased cell wall fragility and hemolysis after processing and during bypass may be seen (5,6). This can lead to excess free iron in the blood which has been associated with negative outcomes (7-12). Ultrafiltration of blood prior to transfusion can be used to correct known issues with bank blood. • The method below provides the perfusionist one option for correcting issues with bank blood before transfusion to the pump circuit (13-15). This is done using the blood bag as the reservoir, a blood spike pin, an additional stopcock, and the cell saver circuit blood line. In short, after transferring heparinized plasmalyte to the blood bag, the filtered blood from the bag is directed to the MUF circuit by way of a line from the stopcock of the quick prime line and returned to the blood bag by way of the (MUF) return line to a dispensing pin in the other port of the blood bag.","1. A licensed or provisionally licensed perfusionist performs this procedure per prescriber order. 2. It is the responsibility of the perfusionist to ensure aseptic assembly and priming of the cell saver circuit prior to use. 3. Transfusion of all blood products, including cell saver processed blood, must be in compliance with the Transfusion of Blood and Blood Components policy as outlined in the Patient Care Manual (1). 4. Purpose a. To provide a guideline for the use of the Sorin Xtra Autotransfusion System. This system may be used for traditional cell saver use and for processing red blood cells immediately before transfusion.","1. The CVOR must discuss hematocrit management during the prebypass huddles. 2. Decrease starting reservoir volume. 3. Consider using albumin if allowed. See Perfusion Policy 05: Unique Techniques and Patient Considerations for Bypass. 2.6 Bypass Prime Selection. 4. Antegrade autologous prime of the venous line by pulling back via manifold pre-bypass. 5. Use a smaller than standard bypass circuit. Consider 'pushing' the limits of the bypass tubing used. 6. Decrease blood gas frequency to only 10 minutes on CPB and at rewarm as long as the in-line monitor is trending well. 7. Use ≤ 0.5 cc per blood gas. 8. Consider decreasing ACT frequency to post heparin bolus and Q30. 9. Heparin can be given earlier than normal to allow for pump sucker use. 10. Consider simplified modified UF immediately post bypass. Two angled venous cannulae; remind surgeon to keep IVC cannula in and unclamped to provide SMUF during epicardial Echo. 11. Consider pH stat blood gas management to maximize cerebral blood flow. 12. Cell saver use may be used. There must be a continuous path from the patient, to the cell saver, back to the patient. The blood collection bag is connected to the pump prime line and also connected to an anesthesia primed volume delivery line. The anesthesia portion is clamped off until the blood is processed at the end of the pump run. At that point the perfusion prime line is disconnected. This is possible because you already have a continuous circuit with the patient. When all the blood is processed, the blood collection bag, attached to the patient, may be disconnected from the cell saver and handed to Anesthesia. 13. The target temp may be lower than normal and based on NIRS readings. 14. After standard cardioplegia delivery, flush the CPG circuit into either the cell saver or bypass circuit with ongoing UF. Utilize crystalloid cardioplegia for this so as to keep that circuit ready for use. 15. Patient will be rewarmed to 35 degrees if possible; if rectal temp is slow to rewarm, consideration will be given to the fact that MUF provides warming and will likely last 8-12 minutes post bypass. 16. NIRS will be monitored continuously with a predetermined value set by the team as a possible transfusion trigger (i.e., <40-45%). 17. Hematocrit will be monitored continuously with a predetermined value set by the team as a possible transfusion trigger (i.e., 20-24%). 18. Larger patients may tolerate autologous blood donation during the prebypass period.",• The bypass circuit venous limb is drained with crystalloid back to the bypass cardiotomy venous reservoir. • ECMO team crystalloid primes the ECMO circuit in the standard fashion. • Add 50 ml of 5% albumin to the ECMO prime bag and recirculate. • Empty the prime bag as much as possible to minimize hemodilution once the CPB/cell saver washed blood is added. • Add 200-250ml of CPB pump blood (patient whole blood) and 250-350ml of cell saver washed PRBCs (or salvaged product) to the prime bag. The pump blood is heparinized while the cell saver blood is not. • Add 400 units of heparin. • Chase as much crystalloid out of the circuit as possible and recirculate. • Add 25 mEq sodium bicarbonate while recirculating. • Add 750 mg calcium gluconate while recirculating. • Continue recirculating and ventilate with 100% oxygen at 1 LPM for 2 minutes. • Run a circuit blood gas and make changes to the prime as needed. • Hand lines up to the field and commence ECMO per normal standard with a time-out before initiation.,4,3,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
What are the potential sources of transmission for CRE and how can healthcare workers minimize the risk of spreading the infection to other patients,1,"1. Standard Precautions are the primary strategy for prevention and control of healthcare-associated infection and are followed in the care of ALL patients in the hospital regardless of their diagnosis or presumed infection status. a. Standard Precautions are designed to reduce the risk of transmission of microorganisms from both recognized and unrecognized sources of infection in health care facilities. Standard Precautions apply to: b. Blood c. All body fluids, secretions, and excretions except sweat and tears d. Non-intact skin e. Mucous membranes","1. Occupational exposure and acquisition of infection is a special concern for pregnant health care workers (HCWs). Certain infections may be more severe during pregnancy and some viruses that may be transmitted transplacentally have been associated with adverse effects on the fetus. Anxiety and concern is often related to misinformation about the transmission and epidemiology of these and other infectious agents. 2. If you are concerned about exposure to an infectious disease at work that could affect your unborn baby, remember that the possibility of transmission is not increased by your pregnancy. The risk of transmission is minimized by consistent utilization of standard precautions for all patient care, utilization of transmission-based precautions (airborne, droplet, contact) as necessary, and to your own immune status. Pre-existing immunity to such potential pathogens as varicella, hepatitis B and rubella will not be affected by your pregnancy. 3. It is not necessary to routinely exclude pregnant or potentially pregnant HCWs from the care of patients with infectious microorganisms.","Activities/programs to prevent, reduce the risks of and control transmission of healthcare-associated infections include but are not limited to: 1. Standard Precautions and policies and procedures that define the indications for precautions to prevent transmission of infections (e.g., Airborne, Droplet, Contact and Enhanced Contact Precautions) 2. The BCH Exposure Control Plan to protect health care workers from exposure to bloodborne pathogens 3. The BCH TB Control Plan to protect healthcare workers, patients and families from exposure to tuberculosis 4. Hand Hygiene program to improve adherence with hand hygiene recommendations, including but not limited to: installation of alcohol-based hand sanitizer throughout the institution and monitoring of adherence in selected areas with review of data and feedback on improvement initiatives. 5. Occupational Health Service programs to protect healthcare workers including: a. TB screening b. Vaccination and immunizations c. Communicable disease exposure management d. Respiratory protection medical clearance and fit-testing 6. Infection Prevention and Control Department consultation to appropriate hospital committees and practice groups. 7. The BCH Infection Prevention and Control Liaison program to enhance infection prevention and control expertise at the local level 8. Processes for equipment management including cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization and storage 9. Identification and implementation of safer medical devices and other engineering controls and personal protective equipment 10. Ongoing infection prevention and control educational programs for staff, including but not limited to new employee orientation, mandatory yearly reviews ( MYR ) and other continuing education programs 11. Epidemiologic investigations of outbreaks of infections, clusters or unusual occurrences and implementation of control measures as indicated 12. Development of response plans for new infection prevention and control issues, such as biological agents associated with acts of terrorism and emerging or reemerging pathogens, for example pandemic flu and Sars-CoV2 13. Communication with the Department of Public Health regarding reportable communicable diseases 14. Infection control risk assessment (ICRA) for construction and renovation projects","This plan outlines procedures for handling a myriad of scenarios involving infectious disease events. The guidelines are designed to ensure the safety and well being of all patients, visitors, employees and staff. The objectives of this plan are to provide direction for the prompt identification and isolation of potentially infectious patients, and to minimize exposure and transmission to other patients, visitors and personnel. The response to an influx of contagious patients is contingent upon the nature and magnitude of the event, the mode of transmission of the infecting organism and the availability of resources.","1. CDC categorizes certain procedures as high risk for potential transmission of TB when they are performed on a patient with confirmed or suspected TB disease. These include: autopsy, bronchoscopy, cough induction, inhalation therapy, sputum collection, suctioning, and selected surgical procedures. These types of procedures are likely to generate droplet nuclei; carefully consider infection prevention and control implications prior to performing these procedures on patients with known or suspected TB disease. Procedure and Department-Specific Considerations Autopsies 1. Autopsies performed on bodies with suspected or confirmed TB disease can pose a high risk for transmission of M. tuberculosis , particularly during the performance of aerosol-generating procedures (e.g., median sternotomy). Persons who handle bodies might be at risk for transmission of TB. Because certain procedures performed as part of an autopsy might generate infectious aerosols, Airborne Precautions is required. Post Airborne Precaution signs outside the autopsy setting for the duration of the procedure and until adequate time has passed after the autopsy for air exchange of the setting. If time delay is not feasible, the autopsy staff should continue to wear respirators while they are in the room Cough-Inducing Procedures 1. Cough-inducing procedures include: endotracheal intubation, endotracheal suctioning, diagnostic sputum induction, aerosol treatment and bronchoscopy. Irrigation of a tuberculosis abscess is also considered to be a procedure with a risk for aerosolizing tubercle bacilli. If possible avoid or postpone cough-inducing procedures, until the patient is determined to be noninfectious. If postponing the procedure is not an option, perform in a room or an enclosure, such as a portable HEPA-filtered booth that meets the ventilation requirements for an Airborne Precautions room with staff wearing respiratory protection. Post an Airborne Precaution sign outside the room or enclosure for the duration of the procedure and until adequate time has passed after the procedure for air exchange of the setting. Dental-Care Settings 1. Dental procedures and manipulation should be postponed until the patient is no longer infectious. The generation of droplet nuclei containing M. tuberculosis as a result of dental procedures has not been demonstrated. Nonetheless, oral manipulations during dental procedures could stimulate coughing and dispersal of infectious particles. Patients and dental health care workers (HCWs) share the same air space for varying periods, which contributes to the potential for transmission of M. tuberculosis in dental settings. In the event that a dental procedure needs to be performed on a patient with TB disease, contact Infection Prevention and Control via pager 2058. Dialysis Unit Certain patients with TB disease may need chronic dialysis for treatment of end stage renal disease. Perform hemodialysis procedures for hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed TB disease in an Airborne Precautions room. Ambulatory patients with TB disease who need repeated hemodialysis require special arrangements; page Infection Prevention & Control on-call, pager 2058, for assistance. Laboratory Biosafety level (BSL)-2 practices and procedures, containment equipment, and facilities are required for non- aerosol-producing manipulations of clinical specimens (e.g., preparing direct smears for acid-fast staining when done in conjunction with training and periodic checking of competency). All specimens suspected of containing M. tuberculosis (including specimens processed for other microorganisms) are handled in a Class II biological safety cabinet (BSC). All acid-fast smears (except occasional direct smears) and cultures are processed for Boston Children's Hospital by the State Laboratory Institute, Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Surgery Boston Children's Hospital does not have an operating room with negative pressure or a negative pressure anteroom. However, ventilation in the Boston Children's Hospital operating rooms meets or exceeds American Institute of Architects requirements for OR ventilation and provides adequate air exchange and filtration for accommodation of the patient with TB disease. To minimize possible transmission of TB in the perioperative setting, the following procedures must be implemented: Postpone elective procedures for patients with TB disease until the patient is no longer infectious. If a surgical procedure must be done, schedule it when a minimum number of healthcare workers and other patients are present in the surgical suite, and at a time that maximizes the interval between that infectious case and the next, e.g., at the end of the regular work day. Keep doors closed during the procedure; limit traffic in and out of the room as well as in the corridor outside the room to a minimum. These precautions apply to pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB, as tubercle bacilli in extrapulmonary lesions can become airborne during operative procedures. Staff must wear N-95 respirators or PAPRs throughout the procedure. Place a bacterial filter on the patient's endotracheal tube (or at the expiratory side of the breathing circuit of a ventilator or anesthesia machine, if used) to reduce the risk for contaminating ventilator or anesthesia equipment or discharging tubercle bacilli into the ambient air when operating on a patient with suspected or confirmed TB disease. Use bacterial filters that are specified by the manufacturer to filter particles 0.3 µm in size in both the unloaded and loaded states with a filter efficiency of >95% (i.e., filter penetration of <5%) at the maximum design flow rates of the ventilator for the service life of the filter, as specified by the manufacturer. Postoperative recovery occurs in an Airborne Precautions Room in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU).",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

What are some examples of films that must be kept in a more secure location according to the hospital policy,0,"• There are circumstances under which films must be kept in a more secure location. Some of the films that fall into this category are: films of suspected child abuse, legal cases and high profile cases. • In general, we do not ""loan"" films to outside locations, but will make copies.","Outside Images that are not requested to become part of the patient's medical record When outside images are returned to the Radiology Image Service Center, they are to be mailed back to the appropriate hospital. If outside images are received by the Image Service Area, the proper destination for these films should be determined and brought or sent there. If the images are to be delivered to another location within the hospital, the location should be noted on the envelope and sent through interoffice mail. If the film is simply addressed ""Children's Hospital,"" a check will be made to see if the patient is an inpatient, in which case the films will be put in the inpatient file. If the images are to go to a radiologist, the film should be left for the supervisor to follow up the following day. Most other outside images are to be returned immediately to the proper hospital. The only exception to this is when incoming images are unaddressed. In this case, the images are placed in appropriate slot in the back area of the Image Service Center and kept for one month. On all envelopes, either write ""Return"" or attach a note on each envelope and place on shelf in the back of the Image Service Center. • A record is kept of every outside film returned.

Discuss with the CVOR team to determine what the target temperature will be during the change out (normothermic beating/ventilated versus hypothermic arrest). 2. Notify the back-up perfusionist. Have that person obtain the replacement device, sterile clamps, sterile towels, sterile scissors, and antiseptic solutions. That person should also: a. Open and inspect new device for any defects. b. Attach the appropriate size FUG pack boot connection to the outlet port of the new reservoir and clamp it. 3. Prepare the unit to be removed . Remove and cap all ancillary lines from original cardiotomy. (e.g., manifold return, Hemoconcentrator return, purge line, level sensor etc.) 4. Prep (for cutting) the recirculation lines, the reservoir outflow line, sucker lines, prime line(s) and venous inlet of the old unit using alcohol. 5. Place the new venous reservoir next to the old device and move the arterial recirculation line over using sterile technique. Consider sucker line extension from the ""extra sucker pack"" if length will be an issue during the changeout and there is a desire to maintain sucker flow. 6. Notify the surgeon when you are ready to change out the device. 7. Communicate and turn off the pump suckers and use the cell saver as needed. 8. Using aseptic technique, pull or cut suckers off of cardiotomy (leave very little excess tubing on the connector if cutting) and wrap with sterile towel and clamp. 9. Transfer prime lines (P-lyte and blood) to new reservoir. 10. Communicate and terminate bypass in keeping with type of change out (normothermic beating/ventilated (wean) versus hypothermic arrest). Suggest that surgeons clamp both arterial and venous lines at the field as well. 11. Cut the recirculation line from old reservoir and attach to new reservoir. 12. Open the recirculation line and pump (transfer) the reservoir volume into the new reservoir and then stop arterial pump and clamp the recirculation line. 13. Separate oxygenator from the reservoir. 14. Clamp venous inlet port and cut as close to the connector as possible. (use venous occluder as a stabilizing device) 15. Clamp reservoir outlet tubing near the port of the reservoir. Place a second clamp 2"" away from the first clamps. 16. Cut reservoir outlet line with sterile scissors. Remove the old venous reservoir from the holder and place the new one on the holder. 17. Remove any air from the outlet port before attaching to new reservoir FUG connector (Use Plasma-lyte or normal saline for air-free connection if possible). 18. Attach the oxygenator to the new venous reservoir. 19. Unclamp the outlet port and recirculation line and turn on the arterial pump and recirculate to ensure that air has been removed from the unit and tubing. 20. Turn off the arterial pump, clamp the recirculate line. 21. Attach suction lines and ancillary lines to new device (Consider reinstitution of CPB before this step).","NOTE: Depending on the scenario in which the air embolism occurred, the perfusionist may come off bypass immediately and then prepare for retrograde cerebral perfusion, or they may prepare the circuit for retrograde cerebral perfusion and then come off bypass. 1. If emergent, stop the pump and clamp the arterial and venous lines once instructed by the surgeon. Turn off all pump heads until reservoir venting and proper head rotation/raceway tubing direction is confirmed. Check direction of suckers/vent/MUF/cardioplegia heads. May turn suckers on once direction is verified. If not emergent, prepare circuit as described in steps 5-7. 2. Set wall water to 17 degrees Celsius and cool per surgeon preference. 3. Set cooling blanket to 15 degrees Celsius. 4. Verify circuit integrity. De-air circuit. 5. The arterial limb recirc line is normally clamped either above or below the luered connector. Add a second clamp to the arterial limb recirc line so that you are clamped on both sides of the leured connector. 6. Connect a Male-Male MUF Line or FX05 line to the arterial limb recirc luer port. You may also choose to add a stopcock to the leur port before connecting the MUF line. Connect the other end to a venous line stopcock. If using an adult pack with KVAD, you should utilize the stopcock that the KVAD pressure dome is normally attached to. This line becomes the AV BRIDGE LINE. 7. Deair AV BRIDGE LINE to the venous line/CVR by briefly releasing the lower arterial recirc clamp and then reclamp. 8. Ensure 100% oxygen is the sweep gas source. Set at a 2:1 V/Q ratio for the anticipated RCP flow to maximize nitrogen removal in the oxygenator. 9. When directed by the surgeon, come off bypass, clamp arterial line, turn off manifold, clamp venous line near inlet, and unclamp recirc line below the AV BRIDGE LINE. This will allow oxygenated blood to flow into recirc limb, AV BRIDGE and venous line to SVC cannula. Make sure IVC is clamped if needed. 10. Make sure there is a vent place in aorta. Initiate RCP flow at 0.4 L/min/m2 and titrate to a CVP pressure of 20-40 mmHg (consideration should be given to the effect of Trendelenburg on the transducer height). RCP is performed 1-2 minutes until air ceases to exit the aorta as determined by inspection and echocardiography. Reinstitute traditional bypass with pH stat blood gas management as instructed by the surgeon once cannulae and clamps are in their proper locations. Cool to 18 degrees Celsius and maintain for 30-60 minutes to maximize reabsorption of residual air in the microvasculature. 11. Give 0.5 g/Kg (max 25g) mannitol and 30 mg/Kg (max 3g) methylprednisolone regardless of whether it was already administered at the onset of CPB. 12. Maintain a higher than normal pump flow and pressure to facilitate air removal from the microvasculature and at the oxygenator. 13. Rewarm to 34 degrees Celsius when directed by surgeon.","Environmental Health & Safety -- Safer Everyday Employee falls from slips, trips and loss of balance are the second most common cause of injury & lost time among BCH staff and resulted in around 6 injuries/month and 1,300 days lost from work in 2014-2015 Slips on wet/contaminated internal surfaces are the single leading cause of fall injuries to clinical staff What should you do if you see a contaminated floor on BCH property (non-chemical/non-bio)?  Prevent others from slipping by marking the area with a wet floor sign and/or staying with spill until cleaned up.  Call ESD Service Response Center at 857-218-5118 to request a STAT spill clean-up.

What parameters should be monitored during and after suctioning an artificial airway,0,"• To safely administer isoflurane, there cannot be a leak around artificial airway. • ECG, respiratory rate, blood pressure, SpO , and CO are monitored continuously. 2 ET 2 • The patient's temperature is monitored continuously using either a rectal probe or skin electrode. High and low temperature alarm limits should be set, and alarms active. • It is preferable that the patient have a functional arterial line, but the placement of an arterial line should not delay the initiation of isoflurane. • The patient requires adequate vascular access for emergency medication administration and fluid administration. • The High Risk Suctioning guideline should be followed. Prior to suctioning, patients with asthma may benefit from a suctioning premedication regimen consisting of instilled lidocaine and IV ketamine. • A closed in-line suction catheter will be used for artificial airway suctioning. • The effects of muscle relaxants are potentiated with isoflurane. If the patient is receiving neuromuscular blockade, the level of chemical paralysis will be assessed daily using train-of-four monitoring or a ""holiday"" period off paralytics, per the Neuromuscular Blockade policy. • Non-emergent disconnections from the anesthesia system should be avoided in order to avoid acute reversal of bronchodilator and sedative effect, and potential environmental exposure. A closed in-line suction catheter will be used for artificial airway suctioning.","1. Explain the procedure to the patient and family. 2. Determine if a second person is needed to assist with the suctioning procedure. Patients described in the High Risk Suctioning Procedure and all patients in the CVICU are suctioned by two people, a combination of nursing, respiratory therapist, NP and/or physician. 3. Perform hand hygiene and don PPE as described in the Infection Control manual: Hand Hygiene and Standard Precautions policies. 4. Pre-oxygenate prior to suctioning when indicated. 5. Confirm the level of suction is appropriate for the age of the patient. Suction with vacuum pressure not to exceed -80 mm Hg for neonates, -80 to -100 mm Hg for pediatric patients and -120 mmHg for adult patients. 6. Open suction catheter, don gloves sterile for ICU patients or clean for non-ICU patients. Keep one gloved hand sterile or clean and remove the suction catheter from the package. 7. Connect the suction tubing to the catheter with the non-procedural hand. 8. Suction to a depth no more than 1 cm beyond the end of the artificial airway to prevent irritation/trauma to the trachea and carina, unless a different depth of suction is specified by the prescriber in a written order. a. NICU patients have a depth of suction card posted at the bedside. b. The depth of suction for patients with a tracheostomy tube is found on the Trach Tube Profile Sheet and the Tracheostomy Assessment section of Power Chart. 9. Apply suction while withdrawing the suction catheter. Each pass should not exceed 5 to 10 seconds to decrease the potential for oxygen depletion. Suction can be applied while inserting the suction catheter if secretions are visible. 10. Monitor the patient's vital signs. 11. Consider instillation of 0.5 to 1 ml of sterile NS directly into the artificial airway when thick secretions are present and for small diameter airways (e.g. < 4.0 mm). Practice should be done sparingly, when indicated and tolerated. 12. Repeat the procedure as needed, allowing time to recover between passes of the catheter. 13. Provide post-procedure hyper-oxygenation when indicated. 14. If the instillation of Lidocaine is indicated, follow the above instillation procedure and wait 1-2 minutes for effect.","• Adjust the device settings for Preset 1.

Pause for 30 seconds between sets. • Assist with secretion removal by providing oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal suctioning between sessions and as needed if secretions are visible. Consider use of in line suction device during therapy for ease of secretion removal for patients with an artificial airway. • Treatment should be stopped if patient expectorates frank blood, complains of discomfort, or vomits. • Consider additional sets if obvious secretions are still present. Lengthening inhale and exhale time may improve effectiveness of therapy. • Provide pre-and post-treatment assessments including SpO , RR, FO requirement, breath sounds, and 2 I 2 respiratory effort. Determine the patient's tolerance to the treatment and recommend changes to plan as needed.","• Suctioning an artificial airway entails the removal of secretions by use of a catheter and regulated wall vacuum. It is indicated in patients with pulmonary secretions, ensures the patency of the airway and is employed routinely and urgently.

When is it necessary for the Primary Provider to have a discussion with the patient andor the parentguardian prior to the start of a recommended procedure intervention or treatment,0,"• Unless there is a medical emergency, the Primary Provider will always have a discussion with the patient and/or the parent/guardian prior to the start of the recommended procedure, intervention, or treatment. • During a procedure, intervention, or treatment, something unexpected may occur where the Primary Provider may need to immediately change or perform additional services. If this must be done on an emergency basis, the provider will address the situation, provide the immediate care, and inform the patient and/or the parent/legal guardian after the procedure, intervention, or treatment.","• The purpose of the informed consent process is to have a dialogue. Accordingly, the process should include the following strategies when obtaining consent: ◦ The conversation should be meaningful and unhurried, not a one-sided recitation of the facts; ◦ The patient and/or the parent/guardian should be an active participant in the decision-making process; ◦ When appropriate and if available, consider the use of supplementary information (brochures, pictures, videos, etc.) to help the patient and/or parent/guardian understand the recommended procedure, intervention, or treatment; and ◦ Consider strategies that may include having the patient and/or parent/guardian describe the discussion, as they understand it, in their own words to confirm that the information is being conveyed. ◦ Ensure the patient and/or parent/guardian has read the consent form and that the information on the form is similar to what the provider previously discussed with the patient when a decision was made to perform the procedure, intervention, or treatment • The Primary Provider, or a provider within the same department (e.g., attending physician, fellow, resident, APRN, PA), should have an oral discussion with the patient and/or the parent/guardian regarding the procedure, intervention, or treatment. Designated members of the care team may initiate the conversation and complete the written form with the patient (including obtaining the patient's signature on the form). ◦ NOTE, if another provider is reviewing the form with the patient and/or parent/guardian, they should sign the form as the ""provider obtaining consent"" to ensure that the primary provider is aware that the form was reviewed with the patient and/or parent/guardian. • The Primary Provider with approved privileges from the department to perform the procedure, intervention, or treatment must sign the form. If another provider has signed that they already obtained consent from the patient and/or parent/guardian, the primary provider prior to start of the actual procedure, should just meet with the patient and/or parent/guardian to verify they understand the risk and benefits, prior to signing. The Primary Provider signing the form is responsible to ensure the following: ◦ The content listed on the form is related to the planned procedure, intervention, or treatment; ◦ That there has been a discussion with the patient and/or the parent/guardian outlining risks, benefits, and possible alternative of the recommended procedure, intervention, or treatment; ◦ the patient and/or the parent/guardian was provided the opportunity to ask questions and all questions were answered to the patient's and/or parent/guardian's satisfaction; and ◦ the patient and/or the parent/guardian had capacity to understand the consent process and also has legal authority to consent to the recommended procedure, intervention, or treatment.","The following provides an overview of the informed consent process within BCH: 1. The Primary Provider, or a provider within the same department (e.g., attending physician, fellow, resident, APRN, PA), will have an oral discussion with the parent/guardian and/or the patient that includes an overview of the anticipated benefits and potential risks as well as available alternatives; 2. The oral discussion is documented by completing the written informed consent form, which includes a summary of the oral discussion as well as a listing of the other providers actively participating in the patient's case (including but not limited to Physicians, Advance Practice Registered Nurses, Physician Assistants, Fellows, and Residents). a. If it is not known if other providers will be present, leave field blank. After a procedure is completed, a list of providers who are participating will be pulled from the medical record and made available to the patient (parent/guardian) in the patient portal. The portal list will capture any changes in providers (planned or unanticipated) who join after a procedure, treatment, or intervention has started. 3. The written informed consent form should be signed by a parent/guardian (for a child under 18). For patients over 18, they should sign if they have the capacity to understand the consent process. ◦ Please contact the BCH Attorney on Call with questions about capacity. 4. Please note that there are two signatures lines for the provider: ◦ The provider obtaining consent signature is for those providers within the same department (e.g., attending physician, fellow, resident, APRN, PA) who reviewed the form with the patient prior to a procedure, treatment, or intervention. The purpose of this signature is to assist with those circumstances where the primary provider may be unable to obtain the consent in advance. ◦ The primary provider signature is required prior to the start of any procedure, treatment, or intervention. i. Please note, the primary provider performing the service may be the only provider who discusses the case with the patient (parent/guardian) and therefore only the primary provider signature is completed – both signature lines are not necessary to begin a service. ii. The goal is that the Primary Provider should sign the form after having met with the parent/ guardian and/or the patient. However, if circumstances (emergency, parents/family not available, DCF custody) arise where the primary provider is not be able to meet with family prior, the primary provider should still sign based on the parent (guardian) and/or patient signing the form in advance with a provider obtaining consent. iii. The Primary Provider is an attending, fellow, resident, or advance practice clinician with approved privileges from the department to perform the service(s). 5. The signed written informed consent should be submitted to HIM to be scanned into the patient's medical record. Note: if the form is not signed because of a medical emergency or refusal to consent, document the nature of the medical emergency or circumstances of the refusal in the patient's medical record.","• The Boston Children's Hospital Patient Care Informed Consent form requires the following information to be discussed with the patient and/or the parent/guardian, with appropriate information listed on the form: ◦ brief summary of the recommended procedure, intervention, or treatment for which consent is being given, based on the oral discussion with the Primary Provider; ◦ brief summary of the expected benefits, potential risks, and other options to the recommended procedure, intervention, or treatment, based on the oral discussion with the Primary Provider; ◦ if blood or blood products are necessary, the primary provider or another provider within the same department reviewed the risks and benefits, and the patient or parent/guardian marked the box on the first page acknowledging that blood or blood products may be used during and throughout the patient's stay in the hospital ; ◦ a general review of the key uses of patient information and potential occurrences during the procedure (as outlined on the first page of the consent form); ◦ a list of other providers who are known at the time the consent is signed who will be actively participating in the procedure, should be listed in the ""Other Provider"" section of the form. ▪ The list of ""Other Providers"" should be limited to physicians, advance practice registered nurses, physician assistants, residents, or fellows – who are either performing with or acting under the direct supervision of the Primary Provider. ▪ The position should include a general description of the individual's role (e.g., surgeon, second year resident, or orthopedic fellow). ▪ Do NOT list observers or other clinicians/staff in the room (e.g., RN, students, tech, etc.). ▪ If it is not known if other providers will be present, leave field blank. After a procedure is completed, a list of providers who are participating will be pulled from the medical record and made available to the patient (parent/guardian) in the patient portal. ▪ The portal list will also capture any changes in providers (planned or unanticipated) who join after a procedure, treatment, or intervention has started. ◦ the signature, time, and date from the parent/guardian and/or the patient MUST be on the document; and ◦ the signature, time, and date of the provider signature, please NOTE: ▪ ""The provider obtaining consent signature"" – 1. a provider within the same department (attending, fellow, resident, APRN, PA) may be able to review the form with the patient (parent/guardian) to verify they understand the services, risks, and benefits. This provider should sign the form in advance to assist the primary provider to know the discussion occurred with the patient (parent/guardian). 2. In these circumstances, the patient may be moved into the procedural suite with a signature of the provider who has obtained consent. However, the procedure may not begin until the primary provider has signed the form. 3. The purpose of this signature is to assist with those circumstances where the primary provider may be unable to obtain the consent in advance. 4. There will be two HARD STOPS: 1) The patient may not enter the procedural suite without signatures by the patient (parent/guardian) and a provider (either the provider obtaining consent or the primary provider); and 2) During the pre-procedure time-out, the circulating nurse verifies the primary provider signed before the procedure begins. 5. It is possible for the primary provider to be the only provider who discusses the case with the patient (parent/guardian) and therefore only the primary provider signature is completed – both signature lines are not necessary to begin a procedure. ▪ ""The Primary Provider Signature"" – 1. The primary provider, prior to start of the actual procedure, should meet with the patient and/or parent/guardian to verify they understand the risk and benefits, prior to signing. 2. The Primary Provider is either the: attending, fellow, resident, or advance practice clinician with approved privileges from the department to perform the service(s). 3. Per department practices, the primary provider signing the form should be either an attending (even if supervising a fellow/resident), or another provider with approved privileges to perform the service(s). 4. If circumstances (emergency, parents/family not available, DCF custody) arise where the primary provider may not be able to meet with family prior to the case, the primary provider should still sign based on the parent (guardian) and/or patient signing the form in advance with a provider obtaining consent. 5. The primary provider is responsible to review the form to ensure the document (including procedure type and reasons listed) was completed appropriately. 6. Providers should NOT amend or add additional names to this section of the form after it has been signed. Even if another provider or team takes over the case at some point in the procedure, the full list of providers participating in the case will be pulled and send to the patient portal after the procedure is completed. Note: if there are two or more primary providers performing services during the same procedure, the following will apply: ▪ If the individual skills of two or more providers in the same specialty are required to perform a specific procedure on the same patient during the same operative session, then there should only be one consent form. The provider performing the majority of the procedure is listed as the Primary Provider and the additional providers who are actively participating listed as ""Other Providers"" on the consent form for documentation purposes only. Each provider who is actively participating in the procedure may need to document separate operative notes which are used to submit claims for their respective services provided (with the appropriate modifier code). ▪ If two or more providers from different specialties are required to jointly perform a specific procedure on the same patient during the same operative session, the same rules outlined above should apply. For the purposes of the consent form only, there should only be one consent form with the provider performing the majority of the procedure is listed as the Primary Provider and the additional providers who are actively participating listed as ""Other Providers"" on the consent form for documentation purposes only. Each provider who is actively participating in the procedure may need to document separate operative notes which are used to submit claims for their respective services provided (with the appropriate modifier code). ▪ If there are two or more providers of different specialties each performing a different procedure on the same patient during the same operative session, the providers will each need to obtain their own consent (e.g., a surgeon and an anesthesiologist). ▪ If the Primary Provider listed on the form changes prior to a procedure, intervention, or treatment, consider either obtaining a new informed consent form, or crossing out and inserting the new primary provider name. Please note that the patient and/or the parent/ guardian should be aware of who will be the primary provider prior to the start of their procedure, intervention, or treatment.","• There is a designated care team (including but not limited to the Primary Provider, Other Providers, and other clinical and operational staff who will assist the Primary Provider) that will be in the room during the procedure, intervention, or treatment, which will be documented as part of the intraoperative report that is contained in the patient's medical record. It may take one or two days after a procedure for the intraoperative note to be finalized by the primary provider and included in the patient's medical record. Once this information is available in a final form, it will be made available to the patient after the procedure by accessing it from the BCH patient portal. • As an academic medical center, additional individuals (including but not limited to, medical students, residents, fellows, trainees, or visiting providers who have approval from the facility to observe) may be observing the procedure for educational purposes. • If a patient and/or parent/guardian does not want anyone watching their procedure, they should inform the Primary Provider prior to the procedure.",4,0,0,3,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1
How are events classified and recorded in the Safety Event Reporting System SERS at Boston Childrens Hospital,0,"1. Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) maintains an electronic Safety Event Reporting System (SERS), which allows any staff member to report near misses, errors, or other adverse events anonymously or by an identified reporter. 2. Staff is encouraged to report events within 24 hours of recognition that an event has occurred. 3. If an adverse event involves serious harm to a patient or visitor, either physical or mental, staff reports the event immediately to clinical leadership and program for patient safety and quality (PPSQ). 4. All reported events are assigned a level of severity from 0 – 5 by the person completing the report, where a level 0 means that there was a near miss, a level 1 means that there was no harm to the patient, and level 5 means there was a patient death. An email alert on all events is automatically sent to the HSCT Medical Director of Quality, Unit Nurse Manager/Clinical Coordinator, and the Director of Nursing at Boston Children's Hospital. a. The Unit Nurse Manager/Clinical Coordinator reviews all SERS and, in accordance with BCH policy, signs off on each event and assigns a final level of severity from 0 – 5 upon review. b. For SERS involving an event designated as a Level 3, 4, or 5, the Nurse Manager/Clinical Coordinator reviews the events and ensures adequate review, evaluation and intervention, if required. c. The Nurse Manager/Clinical Coordinator reviews all SERS reports monthly at the Multidisciplinary Meeting where they are reviewed by the Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Medical Director, Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Medical Director of Quality, and the Director of Nursing for Hematology, Oncology, Stem Cell Transplant and Clinical Research at BCH d.

Reports are kept in the SERS database","Employee Injury/Illness The Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) Occupational Health Services and Environmental Health and Safety departments report employee injury or illness that occurs within the Hospital's facilities. Please refer to the Personnel Policy Manual: Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses for further information regarding employee injury/illness reporting. Patient/Visitor Adverse Event The Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) Program for Patient Safety and Quality and Environmental Health and Safety departments require a mechanism for reporting and investigating safety and accident events and ""near misses"" that involve patient(s) or visitor(s) within the Hospital's facilities. Please refer to the Patient Care Manual: Adverse Event Reporting for further information regarding reporting events that create or potentially create an adverse situation involving patient or visitor.","BCH has established processes for reporting and follow up of safety events, accidents and near miss events that involve patients, employees, visitors and others at the Hospital. There are three primary processes for reporting events: • Safety Event Reporting System (SERS) • Employee Accident Report • Security Incident Report The Safety Event Reporting System (SERS) provides direct, standardized entry of data in a structured format: efficient communication of events to the clinical leaders (designee) and the Program for Patient Safety and Quality; rapid identification of events requiring additional follow up and/or analysis; efficient production of standardized and customized reports for department/programs and the Hospital. The PSQ Patient Safety Managers and Project Manager oversee and administer the SERS. Pertinent safety event reports are summarized and reviewed at Safety Committee, as necessary. The Employee Accident Report (EAR) process provides the framework for investigating actual or potential work-related injuries. The completion of the Employee Accident Report provides the documentation from which the BCH Occupational Health Services Department develops a ""First Report of Injury"" form required by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The nature, type, and extent of injuries/illnesses are tracked to identify trends that may trigger further investigation. Injury investigations are coordinated and/or conducted with the Environmental Health& Safety Department to identify both ""apparent"" and ""root"" causes of injury causing processes or conditions. Work-related injury data is analyzed; trends and corrective action plans are presented to the Safety Committee, Executive Health and Safety Committee as well as respective departmental leadership. This year, we are transitioning to an electronic injury reporting system, called the Employee Safety Event Reporting System (E-SERS). The same employee safety reporting process will be followed, but will be reported on a computer instead of on paper. The Security Incident Report provides for the monitoring of all security-related incidents involving patients, employees, visitors, and other people at the Hospital grounds or facilities. The reports are recorded by the Security Department, summarized by number and type of incident, and reported to the Safety Committee quarterly.",The Safety Event Reporting System daily review management supports identification events deemed as deviations in Professional Conduct. Deviations from professional conduct include but are not limited to: inconsiderate/rude/hostile/inappropriate / intimidating/ noncompliant/uncooperative/obstructive behaviors. These SERS are designated as Confidential and do not enter into the routine process of review by the local SERS staff reviewers.,4,0,0,4,4,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
What are the key steps for verifying the prescribers order for enteral feeding schedule type volume and duration,1,"1. Explain procedure to patient and/or parent to promote understanding and cooperation. 2. Wash hands and wear protective equipment as described in the Infection Control Manual: Hand Hygiene and Standard Precautions policies. 3. Check tube placement of nasogastric or orogastric tubes to ensure that tube is in the gastrointestinal tract. Refer to Insertion and Management of Indwelling Nasogastric/Orogastric Enteral Feeding Tubes and 4. Verify feeding order route, type, volume and duration. Double check for allergy or formula intolerance. 5. Obtain ordered formula or human milk. Check human milk and prepare according to the Patient Care Manual: Human Milk Management. 6. Bring refrigerated fluids to room temperature using the waterless milk warmer or a warm water bath (place human milk/formula container in a reclosable bag to separate from water). ◦ DO NOT use a microwave to heat or thaw human milk or formula. ◦ DO NOT have more than a 4-hour volume of formula/human milk in the enteral bag or enteral syringe. 7. Prime administration set. 8. Attach enteral label to feeding bag or syringe with patient's name, feeding type, start date/time and end date/time. Attach an enteral feeding label to the tubing with start and end date/time. 9. Before attaching feeding set, verify that the tube is an enteral tube. 10. Wash hands as described in the Infection Control Manual: Hand Hygiene and Standard Precautions policies. Use aseptic technique. 11. Don clean gloves. 12. Attach feeding set to tube assuring a secure connection. 13. Insert tubing into pump according to manufacturer instructions. ◦ Manually trace tubing from feeding tube to pump to verify correct location. ◦ Set pump for desired infusion rate. Set infusion volume for a maximum of 4 hours. 14. Hold infants during feeding whenever possible. Offer a pacifier to infants for oral stimulation. 15. Change enteral delivery system for inpatients per table below: Frequency of changing enteral delivery system based on patient population <44 weeks Severely Immunocompromised All other PMA patients* patients Enteral Syringe and Feeding Every 4 Every 4 hours Every 4 hours Tubing hours Enteral Feeding Bag Every 4 Every 4 hours Every 24 hours hours *Severely immunocompromised patients: a.

Human Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV) Stage 2 or 3 16. Flush the feeding tube per the Enteral Tube Flushing Guidelines. 17. Rinse 24-hour enteral feeding bags with water after each feeding.","• Breast milk is the feeding type of choice. If breast milk is unavailable, donor human milk should be used according to the Use of Donor Human Milk policy. If the infant is not eligible for donor human milk or the parents decline it, formula should be used. • Typically, gastric feeding should be initiated as a bolus over 15-30 minutes every 3 hours. For breast milk, feeding over longer duration leads to separation of the milk components, clinging of fat to tubing, and loss of nutrients. • Continuous feedings are also acceptable. Specific reasons to consider bolus feeding over >30 minutes, or continuous feeding, include: ◦ Malabsorption. Continuous feeds may improve absorption in short bowel syndrome, and enteral feeding is important for bowel adaptation, prevention and treatment of parenteral nutrition associated liver disease, and reduction in sepsis. ◦ GERD associated with complications or refractory to medical therapy ◦ Signs of feeding tolerance with bolus feeds, such as recurrent vomiting or abdominal distension • Post-pyloric feedings should be given continuously due to the inability of the small intestine to expand to accommodate a bolus feeding. • Guidelines for initiation and advancement of enteral feeding volumes are listed in the table and in the bulleted list below: Weight (grams) Initial Rate ml/kg/day Volume Increase up to ml/kg/day < 1000 10 15-20 1001-1250 10 20 1251-1500 20 20 1501-1800 30 30 1801-2500 40 40 >2500 50 50 • Full feeding volume is 150 mL/kg/day. Target energy intake is 110-130 kcal/kg/day, and target protein intake is 4.0 to 4.5 g/kg for infants < 1000 g, and 3.5 to 4.0 g/kg for infants 1000 to 1500 g. • Guidelines for the fortification of human milk and use of infant formula are available in the online Pediatric Nutrition Care Manual , section on Preterm Infants . These include tables outlining macronutrient and micronutrient needs. • Consider volume >150 mL/kg/d based on nutritional needs (macronutrient, calorie), infant hunger, weight gain, and ability to tolerate additional fluid volume vs. caloric density. • Consider volume <150 mL/kg/day in special circumstances, for example to achieve fluid restriction in infants with chronic lung disease. Caloric density should be increased to achieve target growth. • The initial feeding volume should be given for 12-24 hours prior to advancement. • Once feeding volume has reached 100 mL/kg/day, strongly consider increasing caloric density to 24 kcals /oz, particularly for infants <1500 grams; advancement of volume may proceed more rapidly (up to 15 mL/ kg q 12 hours for infants <1500 grams). • When feeding is interrupted temporarily (e.g. for a procedure or blood transfusion), feedings may be resumed and re-advanced more quickly than when feedings are first initiated. • If no contraindication, infants meeting criteria for oral feeding (See Routes of Enteral Feeding section above) may be offered oral feeding ad lib at the discretion of the medical team. ◦ Whenever possible, oral feeds should initiated as soon as the infant develops signs of feeding readiness. ◦ For infants unable to take the full volume by mouth, oral feeds should be offered prior to gastric bolus feeds, and target volumes should be set as a combined oral and enteral goal.","This reference tool describes a technique for clearing an obstruction from an enteral feeding tube. • Refer to the Nursing Patient Care Policy and Procedure Manual Gastrointestinal section for additional information about enteral tube management. • Refer to the Enteral Tube Type reference tool for detailed product descriptions. Warm water is the preferred agent for managing enteral tube obstructions. Using a gentle back and forth or pulsing motion with the syringe, push warm water through the tube to break up the obstruction. Carbonated beverages (i.e. cola) or cranberry juice are seldom effective and should not be used. These substances leave a residue on the lining of the enteral tube and pose additional clogging risk. If water fails to clear the obstruction, an enzyme solution should be used. The enzyme solution requires a provider order . It is called ""Gastrostomy Tube Obstruction Plan"". To clear a clogged or blocked enteral feeding tube using an enzyme solution, follow these steps: 1. Crush 1 sodium bicarbonate tablet (325 mg). Mix the powder with the contents of one enzyme capsule (Zenpep 5,000 units) in 10 mL warm water. Mix into a slurry. Allow solution to dissolve completely. 2. Instill the slurry into the obstructed feeding tube using a 10-30mL syringe. Allow 60-minute dwell time to ensure the enzyme solution has maximal contact with the obstruction. 3. Using a syringe, pull back to withdraw the slurry solution from the feeding tube (slurry as well as the obstruction). Avoid using excess force to prevent enteral tube damage. 4. Flush the enteral feeding tube with warm water prior to resuming use. Note: If you are unable to instill warm water or slurry solution due to complete obstruction of enteral feeding tube then follow protocol for replacing the tube.","• Trophic feedings are considered in the absence of absolute contraindications and at the discretion of the medical team when relative contraindications are present. • Trophic feeding (also called ""minimal enteral nutrition,"" ""gut priming"") is the practice of feeding small quantities of milk to prevent gastrointestinal mucosal atrophy and to promote gastrointestinal maturity, rather than primarily for nutritive purposes. Trophic feeding has not been associated with an increased risk for NEC. • Trophic feeding should be started as soon as possible after birth if there are no absolute contraindications. Withholding feeds for more than 4 days has been associated with adverse effects on growth, delayed time to reach full enteral feeds, and longer PN dependence, with no reduction in NEC incidence. • What to feed (in order of preference): ◦ Mother's own colostrum or milk ◦ Donor human milk may be used as a ""bridge"" until mother's own colostrum or milk is available according to the Use of Donor Human Milk policy ◦ Donor milk is also used if mother's own milk is unavailable or supply is not adequate to meet infant's needs, per Use of Donor Human Milk ◦ 20 kcal/oz. formula appropriate to gestational age (if mother's own milk is not available and donor milk has been declined) • How much to feed: ◦ 10 ml/kg/day (regardless of birth weight or gestational age) ◦ Do not advance volume or caloric density until infant is clinically ready to transition to nutritive feedings; no absolute or relative contraindications","1. Use an enteral feeding pump (either Kangaroo® or Medfusion®) for patients who cannot tolerate gravity feeds administered over 20 to 30 minutes. 2. Administer enteral feedings through enteral syringe feeding tubing or through an enteral feeding bag attached directly to the feeding tube. 3. DO NOT use intravenous tubing for enteral feeds to prevent the inadvertent administration of enteral feeding via the intravenous route. 4. Use an enteral syringe and enteral syringe feeding tubing via the Medfusion ® enteral syringe pump to administer human milk feeds and formulas with oil added. Note: Avoid using enteral feeding bags for patients on human milk. When feasible, consider changing the syringe every 2 hours before changing the delivery method to an enteral feeding bag. 5. Ensure Oxygen and suction equipment are available at the patient bedside at all times.",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

When should direct communication between the attending medical staff member and consultant be initiated for a patient with critical issues,0,"The level and frequency of communication between a consultant and the attending medical staff member is determined by the level of acuity of the patient and the nature of the issues addressed in the consult. • For critical issues, there should be direct communication between the attending and consultant. • For all other issues, both the attending medical staff member and consultant ensures that there is bidirectional communication between the services or teams based on the request for consultation and any findings. The attending medical staff member is responsible for communication with the patient and/or the parent/ guardian, and may include the consultant if they are providing recommendations that will be incorporated into the into the plan of care.","1. Defines the question or issue to be addressed by the consultant and provides all relevant background information to the consultant. 2. Clearly conveys the urgency of the consult to the consultant. If the attending medical staff member considers the consult to be emergent, they or their designee contacts the consultant directly to communicate the request for a need of an immediate evaluation. 3. Evaluates the consultant's recommendations based on the patient's overall condition to determine if any of the recommendations may be integrated into the care plan. 4. Requests additional consultation if any new and relevant issues arise that may need assistance from same consultant or another service, if so appropriate.","1. During an admission, a patient shall only have one attending medical staff member who is ultimately responsible for all medical decisions. 2. The attending medical staff member may request a consultation so that the patient may benefit from a consultant's assessment, recommendations, and/or procedural expertise. 3. If the attending medical staff member, after review/agreement with the consultant, determines that the patient should be transferred to the consultant's service, the Change of Service Policy process must be followed. 4. If the medical management plan is delegated, in whole or part, the attending medical staff member and/or the consultant who is delegating services continues to remain responsible for ensuring that all delegates have appropriate training, experience and competence to undertake such management.","Transfer of Responsibility The receiving attending must be notified and must agree to accept a patient before that patient can be transferred to his/her service. Transfer of Clinical Information 1. It is the joint responsibility of the transferring attending and receiving attending physicians to ensure that appropriate communication of clinical information has taken place. 2. The transferring attending must communicate all relevant aspects of the patient's care, clinical status, and current treatment plan to the receiving attending. 3. The receiving attending should request any additional information that is necessary to provide care in accepting the patient onto his/her service. Delegation of Communication If the transferring or receiving attending physician delegates, in whole or part, the communication of clinical information, each remains responsible and must ensure that all delegates have appropriate training, experience and competence to communicate the clinical information. Because attending-to-attending communication is such a vital aspect of patient care and safety: 1. When the transferring attending delegates this responsibility to a trainee, he/she needs to document in the medical record why attending-to-attending communication was not necessary. 2. The transferring or receiving attending may always ask that communication take place at the attending-to- attending level. 3. For critical issues, direct verbal communication between the transferring and receiving attending must occur. In particular, this applies to all patients transferred into the ICUs. Documentation The documentation that communication between services has occurred is a joint responsibility of both the transferring and receiving attending physicians and should be documented in the medical record. 1. For admissions from the Emergency Department , the documentation that communication between services has occurred must appear in the electronic Emergency Department Attending note. 2. For changes of service to and from the ICUs , the documentation that communication between services has occurred must appear in the electronic ICU attending note. 3.

What are the potential reasons for discharging a patient from the specialty pharmacy,0,"In the course of pharmacy operations, it is fairly common for patients to complete a course of therapy or even change pharmacy providers. A formal discharge process is rare for community or specialty pharmacies. Boston Children’s Specialty Pharmacy does not require a formal discharge process; however, the patient record will reflect the discharge-related activities and the patient’s or employee’s comments when warranted.","A. Acquisition of Information: Patients/Guarantors with prescriptions written for specialty medications that liaisons will support (a list agreed upon with in scope departments prior to launch) are directed to pharmacy liaisons through a message in Cerner. Patient/Guarantor information is utilized to understand eligibility for potential fills. 1. Patient’s full name, address, telephone number, email address, and date of birth are collected as part of Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH) Registration process. This aforementioned information is made available to the pharmacy dispensing system through an electronic data feed. 2. Additional information needed to process specialty pharmacy medications is collected directly from the patient/Guarantor by the liaison, and either used in the dispensing or operating system. 3. Additional information that may be collected and entered into operating system includes pharmacy benefit information (BIN/PCN/Group/PBM), preferred delivery method, shipping address, and preferred payment type is entered into the dispensing system. 4. Social Security Number is solely collected if needed to support financial assistance. 5. Financial information such as W-2s, pay stubs, and wages may be collected to support Financial Counseling processes. B. Data Collection Points: The following identifies the points at which an attempt to collect this information may be made and by whom: 1. Initial Patient Information: Information stored in a patient’s medical record and electronically sent to specialty pharmacy dispensing system is used for the purpose of determining eligibility for a prescribed medication to be filled at Pharmacy. If information is not electronically sent, it will be entered directly into the dispensing system. 2. New Patient outreach and onboarding: Pharmacy liaisons will collect patient/Guarantor information when conducting outreach to enroll patients into the Specialty Pharmacy. Additional patient information will be entered in either the Specialty Pharmacy dispensing or operating system. 3. Delivery coordination and refills: Pharmacy liaisons and/or pharmacy staff will validate patient information, and collect patient/Guarantor payment information and delivery information when coordinating delivery of their medication and associated refills. C. Specialty Pharmacy Verification of Patient Financial Information: Upon receipt of a potential specialty pharmacy prescription, the liaison will validate the patient/Guarantor information and benefit information through running a test claim with the pharmacy benefit manager and/or payer. After identifying patients, pharmacy liaisons or remote patient support advocates (“PSA”) conduct test claims to determine eligibility to fill with the BCH specialty pharmacy. The test claim process extracts information collected at a patient’s hospital visit from the Hospital’s EHR. Test claim results shows patient eligibility, third party responsibility, and patient copays associated with the prescription. D. Forms: Each patient is given a welcome packet prior to medication dispensing, containing pharmacy information and a number of other documents for review. Liaisons indicate in the operating system that a patient received a welcome packet. The welcome packet contains the following information: 1. Boston Children’s Pharmacy Welcome Summary 2. Boston Children’s Pharmacy Important Information Summary 3. Boston Children’s Hospital Emergency Preparedness and Safety Information 4. Patient Bill of Rights and Responsibilities 5. Medicare DMEPOS supplier standards 6. Medicare prescription drug coverage and your rights 7. Notice of Privacy Practices E. Assignment of Benefits: Medicare Part B beneficiaries are required to sign an authorization form allowing the Specialty Pharmacy to bill Medicare. An authorization form will be collected for each patient/ Guarantor as part of dispensing processes. F. Confirming Financial Responsibility for Non-Covered Services: When a patient copay is determined during the test claim process and no financial assistance is available for the patient, the patient/Guarantor will be responsible for the payment of the patient copay. Liaisons will conduct financial assistance investigation and determine financial assistance programs available through drug manufacturers and copay foundations to patients/Guarantors who require and request financial assistance.","A.

Any patient on Inpatient Psychiatry or WCBAT, who has or develops symptoms consistent with a communicable disease, should be placed in a single room on the appropriate transmission-based isolation precautions. Decisions regarding patient care and disposition are coordinated between the unit attending and the nursing supervisor, and, if necessary, in consultation with Infection Prevention and Control. 2. The suspension of Contact Precautions and Enhanced Contact Precautions apply only while the patient is physically on Inpatient Psychiatry or WCBAT. ◦ If a patient with CF or a patient colonized with a multidrug-resistant organism (as defined by Infection Prevention and Control) needs to leave the unit for testing or treatment in another area of the hospital, Enhanced Contact Precautions and/or Contact Precautions, as appropriate for the condition/infection, must be in effect at all times while the patient is outside of Inpatient Psychiatry or WCBAT . Notify destination departments in advance of the patient's arrival to use transmission- based precautions. 3. A single room is preferred for patients with a known history of colonization or infection with a multidrug- resistant organism or CF. If a single room is unavailable, consult with Infection Prevention and Control. 4. Educate patients about respiratory hygiene, cough etiquette and hand hygiene. 5. In selected situations, Standard Precautions alone may not be adequate for patients who are colonized or infected with multidrug-resistant organisms. Some examples include the following: ◦ Use Contact Precautions for i. A patient with MRSA colonization of the nares who has a concurrent respiratory tract infection (add Droplet Precautions as needed). ii. A patient with MRSA colonization of the skin who has active skin infection that cannot be covered or contained by a dressing. iii. A patient with VRE colonization in the gastrointestinal tract who has diarrhea and/or is incontinent of stool. iv. A patient with a Foley catheter-associated urinary tract infection caused by a resistant organism. v. A patient with a tracheostomy who is colonized with multidrug-resistant organisms in the respiratory tract and is unable to handle secretions (i.e., cover their cough with tissue, dispose of tissue appropriately and perform hand hygiene after tissue disposal). 6. Patients being managed using Standard Precautions only may use the common areas, recreational areas, and dining facilities within the unit. Supervision of hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette should be provided as necessary. 7. Precaution flag(s) for transmission-based precautions will be maintained in the banner bar of Powerchart and within EPIC for communication to other hospital locations. 8. For patients being managed using Standard Precautions only, no Precautions signs are necessary while on Inpatient Psychiatry or WCBAT. It is also unnecessary for staff to wear gowns and gloves to enter the patient's room. 9. Consult Infection Prevention and Control in any situation in which management using Standard Precautions is problematic (e.g. uncooperative behavior). Consideration will be given to the individual patient's needs and level of supervision required. 10. Patients on Contact Precautions may leave their rooms for essential purposes only. If the patient's attending physician considers group therapy essential for the patient's treatment and rehabilitation, then the patient may be allowed to attend the session after consultation with Infection Prevention and Control. However, there are selected circumstances in which patients should remain in their rooms. These include: ◦ Patients with fever until the fever resolves. ◦ Patients with diarrhea until the diarrhea resolves. ◦ Patient with untreated ectoparasites, e.g, lice or scabies, until 24 hours after appropriate treatment is administered. ◦ Patients with uncontrolled wound drainage. ◦ Patients with respiratory tract infections who are unable or unwilling to contain their secretions. 11. Patients on Contact Precautions should have the appropriate sign placed on the door and should be placed in a single room. Discontinuation of Contact Precautions should be done in accordance with Infection Prevention and Control policy. 12. Each patient's clothing should be washed and dried separately from that of other patients. Clothing may be washed using water temperatures that are consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations. The washer and dryer should be wiped down with a hospital-approved disinfectant weekly or when visibly soiled.

Contact Infection Prevention and Control for guidance (for instance, multiple cases of gastroenteritis in patients or staff within a short time period) whenever a cluster of infections is suspected.","• Disabled employees in need of a reasonable accommodation should inform Occupational Health Services or their supervisor of the need for an accommodation. A request for reasonable accommodation is a statement that an employee needs a work-related adjustment or change for a reason related to a mental or physical disability. A request may be made orally or in writing by the employee, or by someone on his or her behalf. The Reasonable Accommodation Request form may be used to request an accommodation. In the absence of a formal request by an employee, if a supervisor becomes aware of specific information indicating that his or her employee has a disability and possibly needs an accommodation (e.g., an employee mentions a difficulty in performing work duties due to medical treatment for a health condition), the supervisor should notify Occupational Health Services and/or the Human Resources Department. • The employee's request for a reasonable accommodation triggers an interactive process whereby the employee and Boston Children's Hospital engage in a dialogue about possible options for reasonably accommodating the employee's disability. Participants in the interactive process will generally include the employee, as well as his or her supervisor(s), including the Department head as necessary, Occupational Health Services, representative of the Human Resources Department, Employee Relations) and the employee's health care provider, as appropriate. The employee must respond to reasonable requests for information in a timely manner and must engage in the interactive process. Participants in the interactive process will be provided information on a need-to-know basis and appropriate measures will be taken to store and protect the confidentiality of medical information. • The interactive process generally includes: ◦ analyzing the job requirements and identifying essential and non-essential job functions; ◦ identify job-related limitations by consulting with the employee and by reviewing documented functional limitations; ◦ obtaining from the employee and his or her health care provider documented information concerning the employee's work restrictions including the duration of the restrictions; ◦ identifying possible reasonable accommodations; ◦ assessing whether the proposed accommodation poses an undue hardship or can be provided without requiring the elimination of the essential functions of the position; ◦ implementing and documenting the reasonable accommodation; and ◦ monitoring the effectiveness of the reasonable accommodation. • All participants in the interactive process are expected to work towards a timely resolution of the request for reasonable accommodation.

Use an enteral feeding pump (either Kangaroo® or Medfusion®) for patients who cannot tolerate gravity feeds administered over 20 to 30 minutes. 2. Administer enteral feedings through enteral syringe feeding tubing or through an enteral feeding bag attached directly to the feeding tube. 3. DO NOT use intravenous tubing for enteral feeds to prevent the inadvertent administration of enteral feeding via the intravenous route. 4. Use an enteral syringe and enteral syringe feeding tubing via the Medfusion ® enteral syringe pump to administer human milk feeds and formulas with oil added.

Who is the NPCO Signatory 2 and what is their role in the approval process for enteral feeding during red blood cell transfusion,0,The purpose of this guideline is to standardize enteral feeding practices during red blood cell transfusion in neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). This guideline applies to neonates with gestational age at birth <32 weeks OR with birth weight <1500 grams AND with post-menstrual age ≤ 36 weeks admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit at Boston Children's Hospital.,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious inflammatory condition of the intestine that affects up to 10% of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. 1 Many factors contribute to the development of NEC but the exact pathogenesis is not clear. Transfusion-associated NEC (TANEC) or transfusion associated gut injury (TRAGI) refers to NEC episodes that are temporally related (within 48 hours) to RBC transfusion. 2,3 TANEC is estimated to account for 20-35% of NEC episodes, 4 and compared to infants with NEC unrelated to RBC transfusion, TANEC is associated with increased need for surgical intervention, longer hospitalization, and higher mortality. 3,5,6 Several mechanisms for TANEC have been proposed including severe anemia leading to impaired blood flow to the gut, exposure to immunological mediators in transfused blood that trigger an immune reaction, and ischemia/reperfusion injury associated with RBC transfusion. 7,8 Multiple meta-analyses over the past 10 years have attempted to determine the association between RBC transfusions and NEC with conflicting results. 6,9-11 In addition, subsequent clinical and pre-clinical studies have suggested that both the severity of anemia and the RBC transfusion together increase the risk of TANEC. 2,12,13 Due to the uncertainty regarding the casual association of RBC transfusion and NEC, many NICUs have adopted the practice of holding enteral feeds peri-transfusion in hopes of minimizing any potential risk of developing TANEC. Over the past ~7 years multiple observational studies and one small randomized controlled trial (RCT) have been performed to investigate the association between feeding during RBC transfusion and the risk of developing TANEC. The findings from these studies are conflicting and with limitations [ see table in related content for full descriptions ]. The Withholding Enteral Feeds Around packed RBC Transfusion (WHEAT) point of care pilot trial has finished initial enrollment at two centers in the UK and may expand to a larger, multicenter trial pending analysis of feasibility outcomes. This study randomized infants born at <30 weeks gestational age to continue enteral feeds (per unit guideline) during transfusion or hold enteral feeds 4 hours before, during, and 4 hours after transfusion until a post menstrual age of 34+6 weeks. Clinical outcomes (including severe NEC, spontaneous intestinal preformation, all-cause mortality, duration of parenteral nutrition, number of days with central venous line, number of line associated blood stream infection, and growth) will be assessed from randomization to 40+0 weeks of gestation, or unit discharge, whichever occurs first. This trial should provide further information to guide feeding practices during RBC transfusions. The wide variation in the currently available evidence and available feeding protocols makes it difficult to determine the best feeding practices around and during RBC transfusions. Stopping enteral feedings is not without risk (prolonging time to reach full milk feeds which is associated with infection and can also be associated with increased risk of NEC). Until further evidence is available, it is reasonable to implement enteral feeding guidelines similar to those under investigation in the WHEAT trial.","1. Verify with Cardiac Surgeon the need to perform an exchange transfusion on CPB and the exchange volume requested (2 times the estimated patient blood volume). • Ask whether the patient’s exchange transfusion volume can be run through a cell saver to reclaim the red blood cells once the exchange is complete (highly sensitized patients can usually have their original blood volume processed in the cell saver and returned whereas ABO incompatible patients cannot). 2. The attending cardiac surgeon or transplant cardiologist notifies the Blood Bank that an exchange transfusion is indicated on CPB. 3. Request and acquire appropriate blood products (see chart below for ABO incompatible usage guideline) from the Blood Bank in the amount needed for the exchange and priming of the circuit. • Example: A 12 Kg patient will need 1920 ml of whole blood for a 2.0x volume exchange plus the circuit volume of 465 ml and the volume to be given to the anesthesia team (100ml). Request 2485 ml of whole blood from the Blood Bank. • The Blood Bank will provide either red blood cell units with plasma added or separate washed red blood cell units and plasma units at their discretion. 4. Modify the perfusion circuit to include a “Y” in the venous line, preferably using the same size as the venous line itself (i.e. use a ¼” equal ”Y” for a ¼” venous line and a 3/8” equal for 3/8” venous line). 5. Connect the venous line “Y” with tubing to a cardiotomy reservoir(s). Clamp this line. • This line will be called the exchange line. • This secondary cardiotomy will be called the exchange cardiotomy. 6. Connect tubing to the bottom of the exchange cardiotomy and clamp the line. This tubing will be used to transfer the exchange volume to a cell saver if permissible. If using a single reservoir for both the exchange and cell saver use, may connect to the top of the reservoir. 7. Incorporate an additional cardiotomy reservoir into the perfusion circuit, if needed, to handle the exchange transfusion volume of 2 blood volumes. 8. Crystalloid prime the bypass circuit. Replace a portion of the crystalloid prime with exchange transfusion volume (per standard practice) and buffer with sodium bicarbonate. • Calcium should not be added to the circuit prime due to the risk of clot formation in the cardiotomy venous reservoir. The ionized calcium should be corrected after initiating bypass once the volume exchange is complete. Verify calcium is >0.80mmol/L before administration of blood portion to cardioplegia circuit. • If an additional prime cardiotomy is used to handle the exchange transfusion prime volume, recirculate the prime through this was well before bypass. This can be accomplished by adding a line from the oxygenator recirculation line to the top of the additional cardiotomy. 9. Discuss the following items prior to initiation of CPB as they impact effectiveness of this technique: • Timing for use of pump suckers; may want to use wall sucker until after the exchange transfusion is complete. • Drawing titers throughout bypass run as indicated below. 10. Mark the exchange volume cardiotomy with the volume desired to be collected (ex., 2x circulating blood volume). 11. To go on bypass, have the venous line clamped such that venous return will flow to the exchange cardiotomy. • A primary or second perfusionist can move the clamps to allow blood to flow normally into the venous reservoir once the desired exchange volume goes to the exchange cardiotomy. 12. Disconnect the exchange cardiotomy from the circuit and either discard it or transfer it to the cell saver per the surgeon’s request. If using the single reservoir technique, move the reservoir back to the cell saver machine bracket.","• Transfusionist accesses Bridge. • Scan the patient ID bracelet. • Select 'End Transfusion'. • Scan unit number from blood product or choose from the displayed list of blood products. • Enter volume transfused in PowerChart. • Select Y/N from Transfusion reaction dropdown, click Continue. ◦ If transfusion reaction is Yes – click appropriate symptoms. If no adverse event occurs during the transfusion, dispose of blood product bags and all tubing in red hazard waste receptacles. If a transfusion reaction is suspected/occurs • Stop the infusion. • Maintain the IV with normal saline. • Notify the Blood Bank and physician immediately. • Do one of the following: • If the reaction is determined to be a mild allergic (hives) reaction : 1. Administer medications, such as antihistamine, per prescriber order. 2. The transfusion may be resumed after treatment with approval by the physician. • For all other suspected transfusion reactions: 1. Report suspected major transfusion reaction to the Blood Bank immediately. 2. Follow prescriber orders to further stabilize the patient. 3. Obtain blood and urine specimens as specified in the Transfusion Reaction order set in Power Chart. Return the blood bag, filter, and tubing to the Blood Bank maintaining sterility. • Continue to carefully monitor the patient. • Compare the blood unit tag with the patient identifying information. Immediately report any discrepancies to the Blood Bank and physician. If a transfusion needs to be held • Access Bridge. • Scan patient identification band. • Select ""Hold Transfusion"". • Click on the transfusion that needs to be held, or scan blood bag. • Select the date and time that the transfusion was held. • Select the reason for holding transfusion. • Click Continue. To restart a transfusion on hold • Access Bridge. • Scan patient identification band. • Select ""Hold Transfusion"". • Click on the transfusion that needs to be restarted, or scan blood bag. • Select the date and time of restarting the transfusion. • Click continue.","Evaluation of the newborn infant admitted for indirect hyperbilirubinemia.

These diagnostic and therapeutic procedures are essential for modern subspecialty care of patients with gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, pancreatic, and nutritional disorders. The GPU is also the procedural home to both the Motility and Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders Center and Aerodigestive Center providing a full array of diagnostic testing protocols for each subspecialty. In this state of the art center anesthesiologist-administered sedation and anesthesia are provided to children of all ages and young adults. The GPU also serves as a site for patient-oriented clinical research and quality improvement initiatives, and a resource center for patient, family, and staff education. The program continually strives to improve the quality of patient care and access to services and to increase awareness and education in the subspecialty areas of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition. This is accomplished through peer review and quality improvement initiates, by maintaining state-of-the-art equipment, by providing family education, and by formal presentations by members of the nursing and physician staff at local, national, and international conferences. The GPU provides expert care for children undergoing gastrointestinal procedures. Both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures are performed with general anesthesia. Outpatient procedures and testing are performed in the GPU, Day Surgery operating rooms, the Radiology Department, and the Nutritional Assessment Lab. Inpatient procedures may be performed in the GPU, ICU, and Radiology Department or in the Main Operating Room Suite. The majority of the patients are seen in outpatient encounters. Presently, the GPU supports endoscopic and gastrointestinal procedures and for the Sedation Service who provide procedural sedation to inpatients and outpatients who require placement of PICC lines, lumbar puncture, bone marrow biopsy, skin biopsy, joint aspiration, or other minor procedures.","The primary mission of the Gastroenterology Procedure Unit (GPU) is to provide care for patients undergoing a variety of gastrointestinal and medical procedures.

The GPU staffing plan provides technical support for GI procedures using Endoscopy Technicians. Post Anesthesia Care nursing ratios are based in the American Society of Peri Anesthesia Nurses (ASPAN) Position Statement on Minimum Staffing in Phase I PACU and Patient Classification/Recommended Staffing Guidelines (ASPAN, 2007) Staffing plans are developed based on the American Nurses Association principles of Nurse Staffing. The principles address patient care unit related, staff related and institution/organization related activities. Patient care related activities should reflect the needs of the patients, a staffing plan must consider the number of patients and the level of care required while incorporating physical and psychosocial limitations. For staff related activities, the principle needs of the patient populations should determine the competencies required of the nurse practicing. Staff skill mix and competencies, as well as leadership and organizational support guide this process. The hospital has policies to support the needs of patients and nursing staff. Thus, these policies recognize the myriad needs for both patients and nursing staff (ANA, 1999).","A registered nurse (RN): • Completes all required sections of the Nursing Admission Assessment within 24 hours of admission. • Reviews and documents the medication history of the patient. • Documents individualized goals, timelines, and interventions. • Ensures the patient to the bedside monitor to assure accuracy in the event that the patient requires physiological monitoring during the inpatient stay. • Measures and records the patients' height, weight, head circumference, and body mass index as appropriate, detailed in the Measurement of Weight, Height/Length, Head Circumference, and BMI policy. RNs apply patient identification (ID) bands and educate patients and family members on importance of ID band. • RNs verify any recent symptoms and/or exposures to communicable diseases and ensures proper precautions are initiated. RNs ensure that parents/guardians know they are required to wear Family Identification (ID) badges throughout the patient's hospital stay. • At the Boston location, ID badges are obtained in the Main Lobby from 7am till 11:30pm 7 days a week.

What are the different concentrations and volumes of Fentanyl and Midazolam infusions listed in the document,1,"1. Assess all patients for the presence of pain and anxiety during transport. 2. For patients whose airway is not secured, treat anxiety as follows: a. Reduce any environmental contributors to the patient's anxiety (eg: noise, bright light) and use age- appropriate distraction techniques. b. Encourage presence of parents or caretakers unless the child's anxiety increases in their presence. c. Restrain the patient as necessary to ensure safety and prevent dislodgement of tubes and lines. d. Provide anxiolytics as needed for patients without other treatable causes of anxiety whose level of distress is excessive and may interfere with physiologic functions or safety during transport, and who otherwise have cardiorespiratory stability: Midazolam 0.05 – 0.1 mg/kg IV (maximum single dose 2 mg) OR Lorazepam 0.05 - 0.1 mg/kg IV (maximum single dose 2 mg). 3. Assess the patient's response, and repeat once at 0.05 mg/kg (maximum dose 2 mg for both) if needed after 5 minutes. NOTE : Benzodiazepines may produce respiratory depression and hypotension, which may be related to the rate of infusion. Monitor the patient's airway, breathing and circulation closely during and after administration. For patients whose airway is not secured, treat pain as follows: a. Remove any obvious sources of pain. b. Provide analgesics as needed for patients who are assessed to have moderate to severe pain, and who otherwise have cardiorespiratory stability: Morphine , 0.05 mg/kg IV for infants <6 months of age, or 0.05 - 0.1 mg/kg IV for older infants and children (maximum single dose 5 mg) OR Fentanyl 1 – 2 micrograms/kg IV (maximum single dose 100 micrograms) 4. Reassess the patient's pain and repeat once after five minutes if needed at the following dose: Morphine 0.05 mg/kg IV (maximum second dose 5 mg) OR Fentanyl 1 – 2 micrograms/kg IV (maximum second dose 100 micrograms) NOTE : Opiates may produce respiratory depression and hypotension. Monitor the patient's airway, breathing and circulation closely during and after administration. 5. For patients who are endotracheally intubated, administer sedation and analgesia to maintain comfort and safety during transport, as follows: a. Sedation: Midazolam 0.1 mg/kg IV (maximum single dose 4 mg) - repeat prn at 0.05 – 0.1 mg/kg IV every 30 – 60 min b. Analgesia: Morphine sulfate 0.1 mg/kg IV (maximum single dose 10 mg) - repeat prn at 0.05 – 0.1 mg/kg IV every 30 – 60 min OR Fentanyl 1 - 3 micrograms/kg IV (maximum single dose 100 micrograms) - repeat prn every 15 -30 min NOTE : All benzodiazepines and opiates may produce hypotension. Monitor the patient's hemodynamics closely during administration, and reduce subsequent doses by 25 - 50% if hypotension occurs. Treat hemodynamic instability according to the relevant Shock protocol. Fentanyl may also produce chest wall rigidity, especially if administered rapidly IV. 6. Referring hospitals may initiate continuous infusions of other sedatives prior to the transport team's arrival. If the patient is already receiving a continuous infusion of propofol , this medication may be continued during the return transport, according to the following guidelines: a. Propofol may only be administered to patients with a secure airway (ie, endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube). b. Propofol infusions may be titrated to maintain an adequate level of sedation during transport over a range of dosing from 12.5 – 125 micrograms/kg/min. c. Propofol infusions result in a dose-related reduction in blood pressure. If the patient's mean blood pressure falls below an adequate age-appropriate level, the infusion should be decreased by 20% and appropriate interventions (ie, fluid therapy) provided according to the CCTT Shock protocol. d. Propofol is not indicated as a long-term sedative agent (ie, > 12 hours) for pediatric patients due to the risk for propofol infusion syndrome (metabolic acidosis, arrhythmias, multi-system organ dysfunction). Contact the medical control physician to discuss management of propofol infusions for patients <18 years of age who have been receiving propofol by infusion at the referring hospital for >12 hours prior to transport team arrival. e. Propofol should not be used for patients <2 months of age or <5 kg in weight. Contact the Medical Control Physician to discuss management of sedative infusions other than propofol. 7. For patients whose airway is not secured and who experience respiratory depression associated with administration of opiates: a. Support airway and breathing as needed according to the relevant CCTT Airway Management and Respiratory Distress and Failure protocols. b. If the patient has received morphine or fentanyl, administer naloxone , 0.001 - 0.01 mg/kg (1 - 10 micrograms/kg) IV, titrated to effect, to partially reverse the opiate effects. Repeat in increments of 0.001 mg/kg (1 microgram/kg) IV every one minute to a maximum total dose of 0.4 mg (400 micrograms). Naloxone may be administered Intranasal, IM or SC if IV access is not available. 8. Dexmedetomidine may be used for sedation or anxiolysis in patients without an artificial airway, or as an adjunct to other sedating agents for patients with an artificial airway (see Administration of Dexmedetomidine policy 07.09).","(These questions are relevant in determining appropriate treatment of the occlusion.) Complete the line history before activating the algorithm. 1.

If fluids only (no medications) were running: ◦ Was TPN infusing? If TPN, check with the Clinical Nutrition Service (CNS) to be certain that the concentrations of calcium and phosphorous are compatible and not prone to precipitation. Review the entire TPN formulation with the CNS to rule out other possible incompatibilities. ◦ If TPN solution, determine if the bag was allowed to become excessively warm (i.e., placed on top of any infusion pump/under warming lights/inside an isolette). ◦ Were lipids also being infused? If so, were they: 1. co-infused into the same IV line as PN or 2. infused through a different access site? ◦ Was the solution a TNA solution (e.g., TPN mixed with lipids in one bag) brought in from the patient's home? 3. If medications were given prior to occlusion: ◦ Which medications were given? ◦ Determine the concentration and length of infusion. ◦ How was the medication diluted for administration? (Determine diluent type & volume) ◦ Was a filter used? 4. Was there a filter in place? ◦ Did the filter occlude? How was it treated? The Pharmacist will help to determine what caused the precipitate in the filter and correct the situation. In some instances, it may be necessary to remove a clogged filter and replace prior to resuming the infusion. Never remove a filter and infuse fluids without replacing it with a new one.","1.

The Hb usually drops from 14-22 to 10-12 g/dl by 2-3 months of age in term infants (termed physiological anemia of infancy). However, in preterm neonates, the Hb drops more rapidly and steeply (termed anemia of prematurity) due to additional physiological (i.e. lower levels of and decreased responsiveness to erythropoietin, shorter RBC life, higher growth rate), pathophysiological (i.e. infection, hemolysis, impaired red cell production) and iatrogenic factors (phlebotomy losses). 1,2 Due to these factors, red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is one of the most common therapies administered in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). A recent large retrospective cohort study of neonatal transfusion practices in the U.S. found that approximately 70% of all neonates with a gestational age <27 weeks will receive at least one RBC transfusion during their NICU stay, with an average number of transfusions per patient of 4.7. 3 Several studies have shown that RBC transfusion in neonatal anemia improves cardiac output and tissue oxygenation, 4-7 decreases the number of apneic episodes, 8-11 and improves blood pressure in mechanically ventilated preterm infants. 12 Currently, the hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) remain the most commonly used laboratory values to determine which neonates would benefit from transfusion, with low values interpreted as markers of diminished oxygen carrying capacity and impaired tissue oxygenation that could be improved with transfusion. Optimal tissue oxygenation is particularly important in neonates because of the rapidly developing and growing body, especially the brain, but whether or not the Hct and Hb are the best metrics to evaluate tissue oxygenation (and guide transfusion practices) remains unclear and is an area of ongoing research. 13-17 Despite reports of benefit in the neonatal population, RBC transfusions are not risk-free. In addition to the known general risks of RBC transfusions (i.e. transfusion-related acute lung injury, transfusion-associated circulatory overload, excessive iron load, hemolytic transfusion reactions, and infections), transfusions given to preterm infants have been associated with increases in systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines, 18-20 bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). 21,22 Multiple observational studies investigating the association between transfusion and NEC have implicated severe anemia, RBC transfusion, or both in its pathogenesis, but meta-analyses of the data are conflicting in their findings. 23-26 Investigating the association between anemia and development of NEC, a recent prospective study of 598 very low birth weight infants found that infants with severe anemia (Hb≤8 g/dL) had significantly increased rates of NEC compared to those without severe anemia. 27 Similarly, a case-control study of 333 premature infants with NEC found a 10% increase risk of NEC for every 1 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin nadir in multivariate modeling. 28 Preclinical models suggest that both the degree of anemia and the RBC transfusion together contribute to transfusion-associated necrotizing enterocolitis, but this remains an area of active clinical and preclinical research. 29,30 The Hb level at which the benefits of a RBC transfusion outweigh the risks in a preterm infant is unknown. This issue is further complicated by the fact that oxygen consumption may be higher in critically ill compared to stable neonates, and that the level of fetal hemoglobin decreases with advancing postnatal age, which affects the oxygen delivery at the tissue level. 31 These factors strongly suggest that different transfusion thresholds should be used at different times after birth, and for different levels of respiratory support. In total, four randomized controlled trials have been published comparing different hemoglobin (or hematocrit) levels as triggers for transfusion (restrictive vs. liberal strategies) in neonates born < 32 weeks, taking into account postnatal age and level of respiratory support. The first two of these trials (the Iowa trial and the PINT study) reported short-term outcomes, 32,33 with follow-up studies looking at long-term outcomes, such as brain volume, cerebral palsy and cognitive function. 34-36 Both studies reported fewer transfusions in the low- threshold groups, but none of the pre-defined short-term outcomes were different between the two treatment groups. The long term follow up outcomes were strikingly different in the two studies, however: the Iowa study (which had a significant drop-out rate, 44%) favored the restrictive transfusion practices according to the 12 year neurocognitive and neuroradiological follow-up, while the PINT trial (93% follow-up rate) found improved cognitive function in the liberal transfusion group at 18-21 months of age. As a consequence of these discrepant findings and in the absence of local guidelines, RBC transfusions were administered to neonates mostly based on physicians’ preferences, leading to large variations in treatment practices until the recent publication of the TOP and ETTNO trials in 2020. These larger trials compared restrictive and liberal transfusion thresholds in premature infants and found no differences between the groups in the primary outcome of death or neurodevelopmental impairment at 24 months of age. 37,38 In contrast to prior observational studies, these trials found no increase in complications of prematurity (including bronchopulmonary dysplasia and necrotizing enterocolitis) in infants transfused more liberally. However, the neurodevelopmental outcomes evaluated in both RCTs measured severe deficits and so it remains unclear whether RBC transfusions (or anemia) are associated with more subtle neurodevelopmental problems (i.e. attention deficits) that manifest later in life. A school-age follow up study of infants in the TOP trial is in progress, and will answer this question. Regarding transfusion volume, studies suggest that larger transfusion volumes (15-30 ml/kg) may be beneficial and reduce the number of transfusions and donor exposures. 39-41 The biggest cohort study comparing 15 vs. 20 ml/kg RBC transfusion volumes in neonates <32 weeks gestation favored 15 ml/kg in infants <28 weeks gestation, and 20 ml/kg in neonates ≥28 weeks gestation, resulting in reduced donor exposure. 41",4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1

These patients do not qualify for fluid replacement under this protocol and require a separate fluid order if needed. 2. Upon arrival to the PACU, use the PACU Arrival Fluid Deficit formula (see appendix) to calculate the patient's fluid balance taking into consideration: arrival time, NPO time (maximum NPO time = 8 hours), weight, IV fluid maintenance rate (maximum 100 mL/hour, regardless of patient weight), IV fluids received in the OR, and EBL. a. If the patient has a calculated fluid deficit and is asymptomatic , the nurse may administer a one- time fluid bolus over approximately 30 minutes in patients without pre-existing disease (i.e., renal, cardiac, pulmonary, neurological). The fluid bolus will be an isotonic solution (LR or 0.9% NS) and a continuation of the fluid administered by anesthesia in the operating room. The nurse may give up to 10 mL/kg or the calculated deficit, whichever is the lesser amount. Note: If the patient remains asymptomatic after administration of the bolus, additional fluid should not be given without consulting the anesthesiologist in the PACU for further orders. b. If the patient has a calculated fluid deficit and is symptomatic, the nurse may administer a one-time fluid bolus over approximately 60 minutes in patients without pre-existing disease (i.e., renal, cardiac, pulmonary, neurological). The fluid bolus will be an isotonic solution (LR or 0.9% NS) and a continuation of the fluid administered by anesthesia in the operating room. The nurse may give up to 20 mL/kg or the calculated deficit, whichever is the lesser amount. Note: If the patient remains symptomatic after administration of the initial bolus, the perianesthesia nurse consults the anesthesiologist in the PACU for further orders. 3. Consult with the anesthesiologist and/or surgeon to determine fluid replacement needs in patients without a calculated fluid deficit. In that case, DO NOT ADMINISTER a bolus dose unless specifically ordered by a prescriber. 4. Reasons for patient to not receive total fluid deficit replacement: a. Patient is able to take adequate PO fluids b. Pt has received 20-30 mL/kg during the perioperative course and is free of PONV c. Pt is significantly bothered by the IV and the fluid deficit is only barrier to discharge","• Heparin 3 units/mL of prime and for crystalloid and blood products hung to be administered through the bypass circuit. • Heparin is bolused before cardiopulmonary bypass as follows: • Neonates: 300 IU/kg (patients < 30 days and preterm neonates < 44 weeks post-menstrual age) *heparin for neonates must be preservative free (no benzyl alcohol)* (6,7) • Patients ≥ 30 days old: 350 IU/kg • Additional bolus heparin is given prebypass at the direction of the surgeon.

What are the annual requirements for staff members in terms of hospital competencies and selfevaluation,0,"As stated in the CHB Nursing Philosophy, all patients are unique and have different values and beliefs. It is through multiple interactions with patients and their families that nurses learn what is most important to the patient and family. Response to diversity involves the ability to recognize, appreciate and incorporate differences in the provision of care. Differences may include, but are not limited to, individuality, culture, spiritual beliefs, gender, race, ethnicity, family configuration, lifestyle, socioeconomic status, age, values and the use of alternative medical therapies. Nurses help families identify what is important to them as individuals and support them though difficult situations. The model of care used is the Synergy Model (Professional Model of Care). This model of care matches individual nurse competencies to patient needs when assigning patients. Nursing care is consistent with the Massachusetts Nurse Practice Act, ANA standards, and the standards and policies and procedures of the Department of Nursing. Unit and hospital wide guidelines and protocols for the management of patients are used, evaluated and updated when appropriate. Guidelines for age specific care are used. All nurses are introduced to age- specific care needs during orientation and are responsible for these competencies each year during their performance appraisals. Age specific competencies range from the neonate to the adult. Through collaboration with other disciplines such as physical therapy, occupational therapy and child life these developmental needs are met. In-services and continuing education programs are provided to maintain staff competency. Staff in-services are offered both centrally and unit-based. These programs meet educational needs identified from a variety of sources including an annual staff education survey. Qualifications of staff at Waltham include: • Massachusetts nursing license • Current BLS • Current PEARS (Nurses) • Completion of hospital and unit orientation • Annual hospital and unit competencies • Annual Mandatory Yearly Review • Continuing education in compliance with Massachusetts Nurse Practice Act • Completion of assigned Net Learning For required competencies, see Unit Specific Nurse Competency Manual.","Roles/Qualifications Licensed Psychologists and Social Workers: Responsible for providing psychosocial evaluations and treatment to children with cancer and hematological disorders and their families.

These principles include the characteristics and considerations of the healthcare consumer, the registered nurses, and other inter- professional team members and staff. The staffing plan considers the MFCC patient needs and interventions and the resources required to deliver the necessary level of care to each patient. Other influencing factors include the organizational approach to the delivery of nursing care services and the practice environment on the delivery of care (ANA, 2020). Therapies, services, and activities related to patient care reflect the needs of the patient and their families with consideration for any physical and psychosocial limitations. The principle needs of the patient population influence and determine the competencies required for safe nursing practice on an ongoing basis. Unit and hospital based leadership provide added structure and guidance in the development of competencies which are evaluated on a regular basis. Additionally, the hospital maintains policies, which are also reviewed on a routine basis, that support the needs and safety of patients and nursing staff.

Severe anaphylactic reactions, including shock, have been observed in patients treated with the LIPOSORBER ® LA-15 LDL Adsorption Column under concomitant ACE inhibitor medication. Temporary ceasing of ACE inhibitor intake to remove its bioactivity from the patient's blood may not always be sufficient to avoid such adverse reactions. The ACE inhibitors should be switched to another antihypertensive medication at the treating physician's discretion. ACE inhibitors are contraindicated with Liposorber LA-15 Treatment for LDL Apheresis. 5. Adequate venous access must be in place before initiating treatment. 6. Venous access options should be discussed with the TAU Clinical team during the initial consult. A vein assessment should be performed if appropriate.","Introduction 1.

What should a nurse do if it is not clear whether a cognitively limited adult patient has sufficient understanding of a procedure to provide informed consent,0,"• Minor Refuses ◦ If the parent or guardian consents to a medical procedure or treatment, but the minor is resistant or objecting, consider consultation with relevant specialty practices and social work for development of a course of treatment that all parties can agree. ◦ If the minor's life or health is at imminent and serious risk of harm (emergency medical condition), the parent's or guardian's consent is sufficient to proceed with the procedure, intervention, or treatment. ◦ Please note that if the minor is emancipated or a mature minor, the provider must treat the minor as an adult and abide by their request regarding the procedure or treatment. The provider should include social work and other relevant specialties to determine if a course of treatment can be developed that all parties can agree. However, a minor (regardless of emancipation or mature minor status) is generally not free to refuse consent for lifesaving or potentially lifesaving treatment. If consent to treatment cannot be negotiated, the BCH Attorney on Call should be consulted as it may be necessary to obtain legal authorization to treat, withhold, or discontinue treatment. • Parent or Guardian Refuses ◦ If the parent or guardian refuses to consent to a procedure or treatment to which the minor consents, the provider should make sure that the parents have been fully informed and understands the probable consequences of refusal to consent, which should be summarized and entered into the medical record. Consult the BCH against medical advice policy as applicable. ◦ If the primary provider has determined that the minor's life or health is at imminent and serious risk of harm (an emergency condition that needs immediate care/treatment), the provider should perform the necessary procedure, intervention, or treatment. The provider should also consider consulting with applicable BCH staff as appropriate, such as but not limited to the Child Protection Program to determine the necessity of engaging appropriate state agencies. • Adult Patient Refusal to Consent ◦ Mentally competent adult patients (over 18 years of age) generally have a right to refuse treatment, even if it may be lifesaving. Refusing treatment does not, by itself, mean the person is incompetent. In such circumstances, make sure that the patient has been fully informed and understands the probable consequences of his or her refusal. The primary provider should enter into the medical record a summary of the information given to the patient as well as indication that the patient and/or their parents/guardian understood and refused treatment. Mature minors may also have the right to refuse certain procedures. If legal competence is unclear or a patient may be psychiatrically committable (e.g., mentally ill and dangerous to self or others), consult Psychiatry.","• A patient aged 18 or older must be informed of their own health status, provides consent to their own care and treatment, and be involved in developing a plan of care. The discussion should also include any limitations to confidentiality of information from or about the patient. • Consent for Care can be delegated by an adult through a valid Health Care Proxy, using the following guidance: ◦ A Health Care Proxy is an individual at least 18 years of age who is chosen by a competent patient (who must also be at least 18 years of age) to make medical decisions in the event that the patient becomes incapacitated. Please note that a valid healthcare proxy document will allow the proxy to make both medical and/or behavioral health decisions for the individual, unless the proxy document says otherwise. ◦ A Health care proxy is expected to use their substituted judgement to make decisions on behalf of the patient that are consistent with the values and desires of the patient. ◦ ONLY the patient can name a Health Care Proxy. ◦ The health care proxy's authority does not begin until after a determination has been made by a clinician that the individual lacks capacity or the patient has chosen to give authority to their healthcare proxy. ◦ The patient is legally allowed to revoke the healthcare proxy at any time, including during current treatment or hospitalization for a medical and/or behavioral health condition. ◦ An Advance Directive (also called a living will) is a written plan of care that communicates an individual's instructions for future health care choices in the event that the individual becomes incapacitated. In Massachusetts, an advance directive does not provide a legal decision-making authority, but may be used by clinicians, legal guardians, and healthcare proxies as a guide to make decisions in accordance with the individual's wishes. • A competent individual aged 18 or older may also delegate their decision making to any individual through a variety of other methods, including indicating (verbally or other means) to the medical care team which person is able to provide consent, medical decisions, and/or obtain medical information on their behalf. ◦ Depending on the circumstances, verify if the patient may have signed a Delegation of Authority form or a Caregiver Authorization Affidavit. These forms are legally binding documents that are recognized as valid medical order documents to direct care and treatment. ◦ Please note that in Massachusetts the Medical Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) form has replaced the Massachusetts Comfort Care/ Do Not Resuscitate Order Verification Protocol. MOLST is recognized by the state as more appropriately addressing preferences regarding other life- sustaining treatment in addition to resuscitation. While the MOLST is recognized as a valid medical order by the state for outpatient and emergency level services, if the patient is admitted to an inpatient setting, then the admitting clinician should verify that the MOLST form is valid and that the content of the MOLST form is aligned with the current treatment preferences of the patient or patient representative, to the extent possible given patient condition and availability of the patient representative. • A cognitively limited adult patient may not be able to consent if the treating provider determines that the adult patient is not able to understand the proposed procedure, intervention, or treatment. Parents of such patients do not have legal authority to consent on their behalf unless they have been appointed as the guardian (i.e., guardian) by a court. ◦ If it is not clear whether the cognitively limited adult patient has sufficient understanding of a procedure to provide informed consent, or if parents of a cognitively limited adult have not obtained court-appointed guardianship, contact the BCH Attorney on Call to discuss options for obtaining consent. • If it is not clear whether a patient meets the criteria to have legal capacity or there are individuals with legal authority to provide consent for a patient, please consult the BCH Attorney on Call.","• Obtain informed consent for blood transfusion for any patient requiring transfusion of a blood component (i.e. whole blood, red blood cells, platelets, plasma, cryoprecipitate, bone marrow or peripheral stem cell). Document the consent on the Blood Transfusion Extended or Blood Transfusion One Time Consent form. • A clinician authorized to order blood or blood components obtains consent for transfusion of blood or blood components. Note: If the patient/family refuses blood or blood components and the patient is a minor, contact the general counsel's office to determine whether a court order requiring a blood transfusion may be appropriate. If a competent adult patient refuses blood or blood components, honor the refusal. • Anesthesia consent is for the intraoperative period only. • Procedural/Surgical consent includes the option for the patient to consent to receive blood or blood products. If the patient/family consents, blood or blood product may be administered during the procedure and following the procedure while hospitalized. • In an emergency in which no consent has been or can be obtained, blood or blood components may be administered, but obtain informed consent as soon as possible.","• Massachusetts is a one-parent consent state, so both parents do not need to consent for a procedure, intervention, or treatment. ◦ It is important to check if there is a BCH policy for a specific service that may require family alignment on the recommended procedure to ensure continuity of care and treatment following the procedure (e.g., certain services provided in the Gender Multispecialty Service (GeMS) require both parents consent to ensure the child receives treatment following the procedure). • If the parents are divorced or where there is a custody order, it is important to ascertain whether both parents have legal custody. If one parent has been granted sole legal custody, then that parent is the only person who has medical decision-making authority and only that parent can give informed consent. • If the parents disagree about the proper course of treatment, the provider only needs to obtain consent from a parent with legal custody/authority for medical decision-making. It may be helpful to consider which parent has custodial rights or where the patient is currently residing to determine who has authority to consent for treatment. • If a biological parent is not on the birth certificate and is not married to the mother, they have no legal rights relative to the child. The only circumstances under which that parent will have the right to make medical decisions is if there is an order from a court establishing paternity or otherwise granting the parent legal rights; or if the parent with legal custody has delegated decision-making authority to the biological parent. • If the patient presents with a family member who is not a legal guardian, the Primary Provider or their designee should ascertain the possibility of contacting the parent. If the situation is an emergency, the procedure should be performed and document the emergency situation, the reasons consent could not be obtained, and discuss with the parent/guardian after the procedure. • The BCH Interpreter Services (either an in-house member of the BCH interpreter services department or a contracted service using a video or audio language line) should be utilized anytime the primary provider or the designated member of the care team obtaining the signed consent cannot communicate in the patient and/or the parent/guardian's preferred language. ◦ Note: BCH providers and staff may communicate directly with patients and/or their parents/ guardians in their primary language without a BCH medical interpreter – PROVIDED THAT they meet the BCH bilingual criteria; which is demonstrating that the provider or staff have either (1) received their clinical training in a second language, or (2) have been at BCH for at least 10 years and been practicing in the patient's primary language. BCH will verify the staff as having met of the criteria through either an attestation or certification assessment that is maintained by the HR office who updates the provider's profile to indicate internal approval. ◦ If the BCH Interpreter Services is not available, do not use a family member. Instead, consider using the interpreter service language lines, and documenting how the specific consent was obtained as outlined on the second page of the BCH standard consent form. • A parent (or parents) can delegate their medical decision-making authority to an agent or representative. In order for such delegation to be valid, it must be in writing and signed by, or at the direction of, the parent(s) or guardian(s) involved, and it must be attested by at least two witnesses with capacity who are 18 years of age or older. According to Massachusetts law: ◦ a delegation of authority may not exceed 60 days; ◦ a new delegation of authority may be executed when one expires; ◦ when a legal guardian delegates decision-making authority to another adult with capacity, the legal guardian is NOT waiving their rights to make decisions; and ◦ a temporary agent may not be appointed where there is a living parent whose whereabouts are known, and is willing and able to provide care and custody. ◦ Legal guardians who need to delegate legal decision-making for greater than 60 days can execute a Massachusetts Caregiver Affidavit which is valid for up to two years. This affidavit must be executed in front of a notary, the legal guardian, the proposed caregiver, and two witnesses who must all be in attendance. ◦ Massachusetts also enacted the CARE act which allows an adult to designate a ""caregiver"" who can assist with discharge planning, but cannot make medical decisions on behalf of the patient. It is important to distinguish between a person with a signed ""Caregiver Affidavit"" to allow medical decision making versus a person who was designated a general Caregiver to assist with discharge planning and care/treatment at home. Note: If there are questions about the validity of a legal document or other paperwork granting someone authority to consent for a procedure, intervention, or treatment, consult the BCH Attorney on Call.","1. Is it possible to voluntarily submit data to the NIH GWAS Repository? Yes. The NIH is hoping that even when the policy is not triggered, investigators will voluntarily share their data. If an investigator voluntarily submits data to GWAS – the submission must be in compliance with the GWAS Policy. 2. How do you submit materials for the open-access portion of the Repository? Unless otherwise described in the grant announcement, these materials (The protocol, questionnaires, variables measured and other supporting documentation) should be submitted at the same time the genotype/phenotype information is submitted to the controlled access portion. Specific instructions will be part of the grant instructions. 3. Who is responsible for submitting data to the NIH GWAS Repository? The person/entity who is receiving the NIH funds for the GWAS analyses is responsible for submitting the data. For multi-institution research, the single submitting person/center is responsible for ascertaining the compliance of all centers. 4. How do you submit coded genotype-phenotype data to the NIH GWAS Repository? a. Each submission must include a letter of certification signed by the Institutional Official. This letter certifies that the IRB has reviewed and verified the following: i. That the submission of the data is consistent with the informed consent form of study participants from whom the data was initially obtained ii. That the de-identification of the data sets is consistent with the GWAS standards (HIPAA standards) iii. That the risks to individuals, their families and groups or populations associated with the data submitted has been considered and iv. That the genotype and phenotype data to be submitted were collected in a manner consistent with the Common Rule (federal law re: human research protections) b. The submitting investigator must provide the following documents to the IRB: i. Description of what genotype/phenotype data is being submitted to the NIH GWAS Repository ii. Copy of the consent form/s used to collect the initial data/samples NOTE : This must include forms from all sites. iii. Description of the method/s used for coding the data iv. Description of how the link will be maintained with assertion that it will never be shared with the NIH. v. NIH ID# of the grant 5. Is there a specific 'certification' form that you should use for submission of genotype/phenotype data into the NIH GWAS Repository? Yes. Children's Hospital has developed language for a certification letter to be signed by the Vice President, Research Administration. Before signing the required form, the Vice President will want to know that that the IRB has made the required determinations. Please contact the IRB office to discuss the submission of data. When review is completed, the certification letter with institutional signature will be sent to the PI for submission to NIH. 6. What happens if the IRB determines that the initial consent forms are not consistent with submission of data to the NIH GWAS Repository? The data cannot be submitted. The only way to submit the data would be if study participants were re- contacted and re-consented. a. Re-consent requires submission of an amendment to the IRB. The IRB would have to consider whether re-contact and re-consent is feasible and/or appropriate. b. NIH has said that investigators can request funds to cover the expense of re-consenting. 7. What if study participants cannot be re-contacted for a new consent? At this time, the NIH will not accept data without an IRB approved consent form. 8. What if the initial consent form included language consistent with sharing genetic data with the NIH but limited the research to a single disease/condition? The IRB can determine that the data can be submitted – but that the NIH GWAS Repository can only make the data available for that restricted use. 9. What if the original data and tissue were collected under a waiver of consent? At this time, the NIH will not accept data that was obtained without informed consent and a form documenting that consent.",1,4,0,3,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1

The FTE allocation generated by the budget preparation process is structured into a core coverage plan for each patient care unit, supplemented by a volume-scaled staffing matrix to support daily adjustment decisions. 2. Supplementary Staffing and Unbudgeted Expenditures a. The FTE budget provides a sufficient number of positions, registered in the position control system, to provide staffing at budgeted WHPPD levels for the projected patient volumes, including coverage for the scheduled portion of the earned time entitlement. Coverage for estimated usage of unscheduled earned time and LOAs may be covered by the central staffing pools (med/surg., critical care, main OR) when available. b. In cases of wide census fluctuation, acuity swings, or extraordinary events, staffing adjustments become necessary. The department's preferred approach to managing these situations is through schedule variances. However, there are many occasions when these approaches do not suffice and alternative methods must be employed. i. Surplus Coverage Options (in preferred order) i. Temporary reassignment to a unit with a staff shortage (float) ii. Use of earned time ii. Coverage Shortfall Options i. Temporary reassignment from a unit with a staffing surplus.

According to the hospital policy what is the time limitation for dismissing an Allegation of Research Misconduct,0,"The RIO may dismiss an Allegation brought more than six (6) years after the alleged Research Misconduct occurred, unless (1) the Respondent continues or renews any incident through citation, re-publication, or other use of the research record that is alleged to have been Fabricated, Falsified, or Plagiarized; or (2) the alleged Research Misconduct, would possibly have a substantial adverse effect on the health or safety of the public. BCH shall retain all records related to Research Misconduct proceeding for seven (7) years after completion of the institutional or PHS-related proceeding, whichever is later. This includes documentation of rationale for excluded documents that were deemed irrelevant or duplicate. At the end of the seven years, records are subject to the BCH Record Retention Policy.","Allegation An Allegation is a disclosure of possible Research Misconduct by any means of communication. The disclosure may be written or oral. Complainant A person (s) who makes a good faith Allegation of Research Misconduct. Inquiry Preliminary information gathering and fact-finding to determine whether an Allegation warrants an Investigation . Investigation Formal development of a factual record and the examination of that record leading to a decision not to make a finding of Research Misconduct or to a recommendation for a finding of Research Misconduct, which may include a recommendation for other appropriate actions.

With sterile scissors, cut the catheter just proximal to the damaged area. 13. Scrub the cut end of the catheter for two minutes with Alcavis-soaked gauze. 14. Pass lock nut over the catheter, using 3 mL syringe to guide adapter into catheter. 15. Assure adapter is inserted (at least ½"") fully into the base of the catheter. 16. Join the lock nut and the main body of the Titanium adapter together. The lock nut secures the main body of the Titanium adapter. 17. Ensure the adapter is engaged to the catheter by gently tugging. 18. Attach transfer set. (see transfer set change procedure)","1. When attempting tracheal intubation, consideration should be given to using a device that enables video- assisted direct laryngoscopy such as the C-MAC®. This approach is specifically recommended when intubating small infants (≤ = 5 kg). 2. In the event of a difficult intubation, maintaining oxygenation should be prioritized over securing the airway. Consider the use of supplemental oxygenation during the intubation attempt (e.g., apneic oxygenation via nasal cannula at 1-2Lkg-1min-1). Or, in addition, consider the use of a supraglottic airway device (e.g., laryngeal mask airway [LMA]). Consider Sugammadex for reversal of rocuronium- or vecuronium- induced neuromuscular blockade in the event of failed tracheal intubation attempts when mask ventilation is ineffective-- available in the Emergency Airway Kits located in ICU Code carts or from the ED pharmacist. A percutaneous, transtracheal cricothyrotomy kit (Melker 4 mm ID) is available on the difficult airway carts in the ICUs and the ED, & in the Anesthesia Fellow airway backpack. If placing a standard IV catheter to achieve percutaneous transtracheal ventilation (e.g., catheter-over-the-needle Jelco) through the cricothyroid membrane there are two potential configurations (see figures below): • The barrel of a 3 mL syringe can connect a 14-18 gauge catheter to the adapter of a 6.5 mm ETT which then connects to a breathing apparatus. • Alternatively, the adapter from a 3.0 mm ETT can connect directly to the 14- to 18- gauge catheter, then to a breathing apparatus (see below). • When attempting to provide oxygenation via a percutaneous cricothyrotomy, the use of high flow oxygen at 50 psi (as opposed to tidal breaths) may be more effective due to the high resistance of the catheter (see below). • ECMO is a possible option for rescue of a difficult or failed airway but requires a minimum of 30 minutes for deployment, cannulation and effective circuit flow under the most ideal circumstances. To activate ECMO for any area outside of the Heart Center dial 5-5555 and ask for ""Code ECMO"" to your location. For patients in the Heart Center (8 South/8 East/Cath Lab) dial 5-5555 and ask for ""ECMO Stat"" to the location.","1. Connect the tubing end from the field to the adapter kit 3/16"" connector end. 2. Connect the spike end from the field to the myocardial adapter tubing (from saline bag) and unclamp. 3. Start roller pump and recirculate at 200 cc per minute. Attention should be paid to checking the system for leaks. The user should not deviate from this recommended flow rate as the jacket could provide inadequate cardiac protection at slower speeds or leakage from the circulatory fluid at higher speeds. 4. With the system now in closed loop, the heart cooling jacket can be placed around the heart. It is possible to cut the jacket at the designated locations to maximize its thermal efficiency and facilitate access to the heart. 5. Make sure the inside of the cooling jacket (side opposite to the connectors) is facing the heart. Improper use will place the semi-rigid PVC connectors in contact with the heart. 6. The surgeon may request a sterile myocardial temp probe which can be monitored by connection to the HLM base. 7. The perfusionist may monitor the circulating volume temperature using an additional temp port on the HLM.","Disconnecting the Patient 1.

When the IRB requires a written consent form, the discussion or process may take place by a means other than a face-to-face/in person communication. For example, an investigator may discuss the study over the phone or a use another HIPPA compliant method of video conferencing method. However, both methods still require the parent to sign a written consent document. When this occurs, additional steps are necessary to accurately document the consent process, especially if the consent cannot be immediately returned to the investigator. This guidance is to ensure adequate documentation of prospective informed consent for research when a parent/legal guardian is not present. It is not intended to describe the process for obtaining an e-signature (electronic signature) that is expected to meet all criteria to be legally recognized in accordance with regulatory requirements (i.e. e-consent for U.S. Food & Drug Administration regulated research). • Federal regulatory agencies do not regard verbal telephone consent as constituting the documentation of signed informed consent that is required by the federal regulations. • There are times when the IRB can approve a method other than written consent that allows a subject the ability to check a box electronically to provide consent. The guidelines provided should not be confused with the IRB finding that a protocol meets the criteria for a waiver or alteration of consent.","• For inpatient services, consent is valid for the duration of the hospital stay, both during and following the procedure, intervention, or treatment. If there is a significant change in the patient's condition that would reasonably be expected to alter the treatment plan or require additional procedures (that was not identified or discussed with the patient as part of the initial consent), a new consent may need to be obtained for the subsequent treatment. • For outpatient services, the consent remains in effect throughout the course of continuing services, provided the patient is continuing the same or similar recommended procedure, intervention, or treatment for the same initial diagnosis. There is a general standard that a consent should be reviewed and updated on an annual basis to determine if the course of treatment or evaluation being provided has changed since the initial consent was signed. • When the treatment plan involves recurrent treatments and procedures, a consent is not required for each repetitive treatment/procedure, unless there is a significant deviation from the original plan, the patient's condition or diagnosis changes from the initial intent of the consent (which was not something identified or discussed with the patient and/or the parent/guardian as part of the initial consent form), or different treatments are being provided during the recurring treatment plan. • There is no specified or standard time period in which a consent should be obtained prior to a procedure. If the provider's practice is that the consent is normally obtained at a specified period prior to the planned procedure, intervention or treatment, (e.g., one week, one month, longer) the provider should maintain those practices.","Written Informed Consent Form : The written consent form is a formalization of the agreement to participate, and it is used to document a process. Key information : A Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) term. A concise and focused presentation of information, at the beginning of informed consent that is most likely to assist a prospective subject or legally authorized representative in understanding the reasons why one might or might not want to participate in the research. This part of the informed consent must be organized and presented in a way that facilitates comprehension. Legally Authorized Representative : An individual, or judicial or other body authorized under applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective subject to the subject's participation in the procedure(s) involved in the research."" 45CFR.46.102(c) and 21CFR50.3(l). Witness : A third party present during the oral presentation of the consent form and the consent interview. The IRB may require a witness to the consent process based on the nature and risks of research","HHS (45 CFR 46.117(c)) and FDA (21 CFR 56.109(c)(1)) allow the IRB to waive written informed consent for research that meets specific regulatory criteria. 1. For HHS funded research (45 CFR 46.117(c)), the IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds either: a. That the only record linking the subject and the research would be the informed consent form and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. b. Each subject (or legally authorized representative) will be asked whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the research, and the subject's wishes will govern; i. That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context; or ii. If the subjects or legally authorized representatives are members of a distinct cultural group or community in which signing forms is not the norm, that the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and provided there is an appropriate alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained. 2. For FDA regulated research (21 CFR 56.109(c)(1)), the IRB may only waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds: a. That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context. 3. The investigator is required to justify in the protocol how the conditions for waiver of documentation are to be met. 4. The procedure for waiving the requirement for documentation is not intended to circumvent the requirement for informed consent but rather to protect patient privacy. All required information must still be presented and discussed to ensure a voluntary informed consent process. 5. In cases in which the documentation requirement is waived (referred to as ""obtained through a method other than a written document"" in Boston Children's Hospital IRB application and approval materials), the IRB will often require the investigator to provide subjects with written information about the research.",4,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

CDC categorizes certain procedures as high risk for potential transmission of TB when they are performed on a patient with confirmed or suspected TB disease. These include: autopsy, bronchoscopy, cough induction, inhalation therapy, sputum collection, suctioning, and selected surgical procedures. These types of procedures are likely to generate droplet nuclei; carefully consider infection prevention and control implications prior to performing these procedures on patients with known or suspected TB disease. Procedure and Department-Specific Considerations Autopsies 1. Autopsies performed on bodies with suspected or confirmed TB disease can pose a high risk for transmission of M. tuberculosis , particularly during the performance of aerosol-generating procedures (e.g., median sternotomy). Persons who handle bodies might be at risk for transmission of TB. Because certain procedures performed as part of an autopsy might generate infectious aerosols, Airborne Precautions is required. Post Airborne Precaution signs outside the autopsy setting for the duration of the procedure and until adequate time has passed after the autopsy for air exchange of the setting. If time delay is not feasible, the autopsy staff should continue to wear respirators while they are in the room Cough-Inducing Procedures 1. Cough-inducing procedures include: endotracheal intubation, endotracheal suctioning, diagnostic sputum induction, aerosol treatment and bronchoscopy. Irrigation of a tuberculosis abscess is also considered to be a procedure with a risk for aerosolizing tubercle bacilli. If possible avoid or postpone cough-inducing procedures, until the patient is determined to be noninfectious. If postponing the procedure is not an option, perform in a room or an enclosure, such as a portable HEPA-filtered booth that meets the ventilation requirements for an Airborne Precautions room with staff wearing respiratory protection. Post an Airborne Precaution sign outside the room or enclosure for the duration of the procedure and until adequate time has passed after the procedure for air exchange of the setting. Dental-Care Settings 1. Dental procedures and manipulation should be postponed until the patient is no longer infectious. The generation of droplet nuclei containing M. tuberculosis as a result of dental procedures has not been demonstrated. Nonetheless, oral manipulations during dental procedures could stimulate coughing and dispersal of infectious particles. Patients and dental health care workers (HCWs) share the same air space for varying periods, which contributes to the potential for transmission of M. tuberculosis in dental settings. In the event that a dental procedure needs to be performed on a patient with TB disease, contact Infection Prevention and Control via pager 2058. Dialysis Unit Certain patients with TB disease may need chronic dialysis for treatment of end stage renal disease. Perform hemodialysis procedures for hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed TB disease in an Airborne Precautions room. Ambulatory patients with TB disease who need repeated hemodialysis require special arrangements; page Infection Prevention & Control on-call, pager 2058, for assistance. Laboratory Biosafety level (BSL)-2 practices and procedures, containment equipment, and facilities are required for non- aerosol-producing manipulations of clinical specimens (e.g., preparing direct smears for acid-fast staining when done in conjunction with training and periodic checking of competency). All specimens suspected of containing M. tuberculosis (including specimens processed for other microorganisms) are handled in a Class II biological safety cabinet (BSC). All acid-fast smears (except occasional direct smears) and cultures are processed for Boston Children's Hospital by the State Laboratory Institute, Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Surgery Boston Children's Hospital does not have an operating room with negative pressure or a negative pressure anteroom. However, ventilation in the Boston Children's Hospital operating rooms meets or exceeds American Institute of Architects requirements for OR ventilation and provides adequate air exchange and filtration for accommodation of the patient with TB disease. To minimize possible transmission of TB in the perioperative setting, the following procedures must be implemented: Postpone elective procedures for patients with TB disease until the patient is no longer infectious. If a surgical procedure must be done, schedule it when a minimum number of healthcare workers and other patients are present in the surgical suite, and at a time that maximizes the interval between that infectious case and the next, e.g., at the end of the regular work day. Keep doors closed during the procedure; limit traffic in and out of the room as well as in the corridor outside the room to a minimum. These precautions apply to pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB, as tubercle bacilli in extrapulmonary lesions can become airborne during operative procedures. Staff must wear N-95 respirators or PAPRs throughout the procedure. Place a bacterial filter on the patient's endotracheal tube (or at the expiratory side of the breathing circuit of a ventilator or anesthesia machine, if used) to reduce the risk for contaminating ventilator or anesthesia equipment or discharging tubercle bacilli into the ambient air when operating on a patient with suspected or confirmed TB disease. Use bacterial filters that are specified by the manufacturer to filter particles 0.3 µm in size in both the unloaded and loaded states with a filter efficiency of >95% (i.e., filter penetration of <5%) at the maximum design flow rates of the ventilator for the service life of the filter, as specified by the manufacturer. Postoperative recovery occurs in an Airborne Precautions Room in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU).",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

This policy establishes what parameters must be observed and the care that must be employed in both the immediate and long-term postoperative recovery periods. 1. Immediate Postoperative Recovery a. The immediate postoperative recovery period is defined as the period of time following the completion of surgical procedure until the animal is sternal. The following measures must be taken to provide a smooth and safe recovery from anesthesia: i. Animals must be monitored every 15 minutes until they are sternal and documentation must be recorded in the postoperative record. ii. To prevent hypothermia animals can be wrapped in blankets or drapes or placed on a circulating warm water pad. iii. The endotracheal tube must not be removed until the animal displays an adequate gag reflex and begins to chew. An approved member of the protocol must remain with the animal until it is extubated. Leaving the endotracheal tube in place prevents aspiration pneumonia if the animal should vomit and also maintains a patent airway with easy access if complications should arise. iv. Animals must be turned from side to side every 30 minutes until they are able to remain sternal. Turning the animal helps prevent pulmonary congestion v. The animals' vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature) must be recorded every 30 minutes until the animal is sternal. vi. After the animal is extubated and in sternal recumbency, assess the amount of pain and discomfort they are exhibiting and treat appropriately. Refer to the parameters used for pain assessment and analgesics outlined in the policy for Pain and Distress and the Animal Research Investigator's Manual. vii. Conduct any blood work that may seem appropriate at this time. For example, if the animal lost a large amount of blood during the procedure, a hematocrit may need to be obtained. 2. Long Term Post-Operative Recovery a. The long term postoperative recovery period, which requires at least daily monitoring, is considered a minimum of 7 days post-surgery for major procedures, and 3 days post-surgery for minor procedures. The investigator or a protocol approved member of the surgical team must evaluate the animal at least once daily for 7 days post surgery and record the animal's condition in the postoperative care form. In addition to this, all large animals will also be monitored daily by the ARCH veterinary staff to provide additional care if needed. Large animals will be singly housed and exempted from social housing following surgical procedures. They will be singly housed for a minimum of 3 days post-surgery and for the duration of any treatments or recovery. All large animals will be released from the social housing exemption only upon veterinary discretion. The following are a list of parameters to monitor and document in the postoperative care form: i. Note any reduction in activity level or appetite. ii. Pain assessment based on parameters outlines in the policy for pain and distress. iii. Examination of the incision/surgical site. iv. Respiratory rate and effort. v. Heart rate and character. vi. Hydration using skin turgor and if eyes are sunken as a means of evaluation. vii. Temperatures of clinically abnormal animals are monitored daily until clinical improvement is noted. Because monitoring of temperature can be very stressful for some animals, animals that are in good health and are recovering normally may not have temperatures recorded during the post-operative period.",This policy intends to provide a framework to guide the care and planning for the admission and postoperative course for the bariatric and metabolic surgery patients at Boston Children's Hospital. All patients entering the Adolescent Bariatric Surgery Program: 1. Are screened based on the defined selection criteria approved by the Adolescent Bariatric Surgery (ABS) Multidisciplinary Committee in accordance with the standards set by the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP). 2. Attend the Adolescent Bariatric Surgery Information Session presented by the surgeon. 3. Have a psychosocial-behavioral evaluation prior to surgery. 4. Have all necessary testing and receive appropriate consultations recommended by the Adolescent Bariatric Surgical Team prior to surgery.

Preoperative antibiotics Appropriate antibiotics to cover common organisms are needed. One study has suggested that use of clindamycin increases risk of infection. There are several studies as discussed above that have demonstrated a high rate of gram negative infections, and therefore coverage for these organisms makes sense. In addition, appropriate timing of antibiotic dosing is critical, as inappropriate dosing as defined as antibiotics given greater than 60 minutes prior to incision represent a risk of infection. The current recommendations of the AAOS are to use appropriate antibiotics for 24 hours postoperatively. One study failed to demonstrate a benefit of continuing antibiotics beyond 24 hours when a drain is in place. References 24.

TRCA and MCR will be conducted within the PTC by relevant personnel from the primary service. Any event that does not meet the criteria for a Transplant Root Cause Analysis or Mandatory Case Review may still be subjected to review if deemed appropriate. 7. An adverse event is not internally reportable via Safety Event Reporting System (SERS) if: (1) the event is part of the expected clinical course of the patient's underlying condition or procedure; or (2) the event is a non-preventable adverse drug reaction and does not cause serious injury (e.g., a rash following administration of a drug that the patient has never received before). However, a serious complication due to a medication is a reportable adverse event even if the appropriate medication is given at the correct dose and in the proper manner. a. If staff is uncertain whether an event is a reportable adverse event, staff should err on the side of reporting. Staff reporting an adverse event will not be dealt with punitively. 8. PPSQ reviews and evaluates reported events (SERS) to make determinations regarding external reportability as required by law and regulation. a. Any adverse event in a transplant patient that is reported to an external regulatory agency must be presented to the PTC within 30 days of the completion of the Root Cause Analysis conducted by PPSQ.","Adverse Event: harm to a patient resulting from care and treatment, not due to the underlying condition of the patient. For purposes of this definition, we also include errors that reach the patient but do not cause harm. An adverse event, after an internal review by the Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) Program for Patient Safety and Quality, may be further categorized as a ""serious reportable event"" or ""serious incident or accident report"" as defined by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health; a ""sentinel event"" as defined by The Joint Commission; or a ""never event"" as defined by the National Quality Forum. Near Miss Event: Any event or situation that if left undetected or uncorrected may have the potential to cause harm, but did not reach the patient. Adverse Drug Event (ADE): A subset of adverse events that includes medication errors, adverse drug reactions, and drug incompatibilities. Medications include all prescription drug preparations, over the counter (OTC) products, and IV fluids. ADEs encompass harm, or events that require interventions to prevent harm, that result from the use of medications, controlled substances, or pharmaceutical/drug preparation that occur on the hospital premises or are otherwise identified during a patient encounter. ADEs also include adverse drug reaction (ADR), as defined by The National Institute of Health, as a response to a drug that is noxious and unintended, and that occurs at doses used in humans for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or treatment of disease, or for the modification of physiologic function. Apparent Cause Analysis (ACA): A limited investigation of an event performed for selected adverse events that is considered peer review protected information that does not require a full RCA (e.g., Precursor or Near- Miss events). Root Cause Analysis (RCA): A comprehensive, systematic analysis that is performed to identify the causal and contributory factors as well as appropriate corrective actions to prevent a recurrence. The RCA (including internal discussions, analysis, and corrective actions related to clinicians) is considered peer review protected information that is approved by the Senior Clinical Leadership Committee (SCLC). Safety Event Reporting System (SERS): The hospital's electronic data collection repository used for reporting, reviewing, and documenting analysis of events. This includes, but is not limited to, any occurrence of an adverse event, any near miss event, an event or situation that places a patient at increased risk of harm, or unplanned significant change in medical or surgical management not related to the patient's underlying condition. The SERS is a peer review protected system in which any event (including but not limited to adverse events, potential adverse events, and near miss adverse events) are recorded for internal investigation and quality improvement activities. Events reported through SERS are reviewed and classified by the staff of the Program for Patient Safety and Quality (PPSQ) according to definitions and guidelines described in the SERS User Manual. PPSQ determines the classification and preventability of adverse events in collaboration with the local SERS Manager and others within BCH. See Appendix A for further information on adverse event classification. Information in the SERS system is privileged and peer review protected. SERS data and all reports generated from the SERS is intended only for internal review within Boston Children's for quality improvement activities. Without prior review and approval, SERS reports are not available for research or general publication externally to Boston Children's Hospital. Safety Event Rapid Response Team (SERRT): In the case of a severe event (actual or near miss), that, in the opinion of the Chief Patient Safety and Quality Officer, or his/her delegate, constitutes an active threat to patient safety, a multidisciplinary team may be convened immediately to review the event, begin an initial investigation, and implement immediate corrective actions.",4,4,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

What is the primary responsibility of the Institutional Review Board IRB at Boston Childrens Hospital and what does the IRB review research protocols for,0,"Boston Children's Hospital has established and maintains an Institutional Review Board (IRB). The IRB's primary responsibility is the protection of research subjects. The IRB reviews research protocols for issues in design and conduct that may potentially affect the safety, rights, and welfare of human subjects. The review procedures comply with federal regulations, state laws, and institutional polices. The IRB has established procedures to ensure a consistent review process for all initial reviews, continuing reviews/administrative updates, amendments/revisions, and unanticipated problems that involve risk to subjects or others. The convened IRB meets, at a minimum, on the second and fourth Monday of each month. More frequent meetings may be held as required. IRB members are provided protocol materials five to seven days prior to the meeting.","Boston Children's Hospital maintains an Institutional Review Board (IRB) that includes members with the appropriate expertise to review the wide variety of research protocols commonly conducted by the hospital, as well as members who fairly represent the interests of the community. 1. The IRB members will be knowledgeable about regulatory requirements and will review individual research protocols objectively and impartially. 2. Individuals who serve research business and research development roles for the hospital are neither permitted to serve as IRB members nor IRB administrators.","Boston Children's Hospital permits the review of research protocols through the expedited review process governed by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) federal regulations. Protocols that may be reviewed under expedited review are limited to: 1. Categories of research listed in 45 CFR46.110, unless the reviewer(s) determines that the study involves more than minimal risk 2. Minor changes in previously approved research during the period for which approval is authorized 3. Research for which limited IRB review is a condition of exemption. Expedited review procedures may not be used for classified research. The Chair and Vice Chairs of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) are responsible for the final determination as to which protocol revisions/amendments are eligible for expedited review. Each Chair has the authority to designate one or more experienced IRB members to perform the expedited review.","Boston Children's Hospital may enter into formal agreements with other institutions that are not legal entities of Boston Children's Hospital to serve as the Reviewing IRB or to rely on another institution's IRB for research conducted by Boston Children's Hospital investigators. Boston Children's Hospital enters into these types of arrangements through a Reliance Agreement . In both situations (reviewing IRB or relying site), review and approval is required for each request in accordance with the Single IRB Review policy. Boston Children's Hospital protects the rights and welfare of participants when collaborating with other organizations for the oversight of research.

What is the main focus of the guideline statements provided in the document regarding trach and trachventdependent patients,0,"• An RRT is accompanied by an RN and an ICU Fellow during the intra-hospital transport of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. • Patients requiring continuous non-invasive ventilation may be transported by an RRT and RN, unless the patient is unstable (e.g. hemodynamic instability, periodic de-saturation) in which case a Fellow should also be present during the transport. • Transports are discussed and coordinated between RRTs within an assignment to ensure that only one RRT is off the unit at a time. The senior fellow will be notified if there are requests for simultaneous transports. RRTs will communicate any logistical or safety concerns to a supervisor or resource who will communicate with the senior Fellow. • An ETCO monitor will be available during transports of mechanically ventilated patients. The monitor will 2 remain in-line for patients that require strict monitoring of CO (e.g. neuro-protection). ET 2 • Patients should ideally be transported with the same device they are using in the ICU. • The team reviews/completes a transport checklist prior to the transport of patients leaving the ICU. The RRT will retain the checklist upon completion of the transport. • Chronically trached-and-vented patients or patients who tolerate periods off non-invasive support may be transported solely by an RN, provided the patient is deemed stable. In these situations the RRT will perform an equipment safety check prior to the patient leaving the unit and upon return. • Prior to the transport of a patient with a tracheostomy tube, the RRT will ensure that two spare trach tubes are present; one the same size and one a size smaller. • Prior to leaving the unit the RRT will hand their phone to another RRT in their assignment. • Upon returning to the unit, another RRT will confirm that the all connections, gas source and electrical, have been completed. • MRI-specific considerations: • Patients will be transported to the MRI suite with a critical care ventilator which will be tethered in Zone- 3 by the MR tech. The patient will subsequently be transitioned in Zone 4 to an MR-conditional ventilator that has been assembled and passed a pre-use check by the RRT, once the RRT has been cleared by the MRI technician. • On Binney-7, only the MR-conditional Servo-i tethered in zone 4 will be used. On Main 2, the MR suite with the Vida scanner is the only location with a MR conditional ventilator, a Servo-i. • Prior to the transport of patients with a tracheostomy tube, the RRT will verify that an MR-conditional trach tube is in place. Refer to the patient's bedside Trach Tube Profile sheet to verify the trach is MR conditional. • CO will be continuously monitored during the MRI procedure. ET 2 • Purpose ◦ To provide safe intra-hospital transport of mechanically ventilated patients",1. Confirm the patient has the MASHTT equipment listed above. 2. Confirm there is a completed Trach Tube Profile Sheet at the bedside. 3.

It is also unnecessary for staff to wear gowns and gloves to enter the patient's room. 9. Consult Infection Prevention and Control in any situation in which management using Standard Precautions is problematic (e.g. uncooperative behavior). Consideration will be given to the individual patient's needs and level of supervision required. 10. Patients on Contact Precautions may leave their rooms for essential purposes only. If the patient's attending physician considers group therapy essential for the patient's treatment and rehabilitation, then the patient may be allowed to attend the session after consultation with Infection Prevention and Control. However, there are selected circumstances in which patients should remain in their rooms. These include: ◦ Patients with fever until the fever resolves. ◦ Patients with diarrhea until the diarrhea resolves. ◦ Patient with untreated ectoparasites, e.g, lice or scabies, until 24 hours after appropriate treatment is administered. ◦ Patients with uncontrolled wound drainage. ◦ Patients with respiratory tract infections who are unable or unwilling to contain their secretions. 11. Patients on Contact Precautions should have the appropriate sign placed on the door and should be placed in a single room. Discontinuation of Contact Precautions should be done in accordance with Infection Prevention and Control policy. 12. Each patient's clothing should be washed and dried separately from that of other patients. Clothing may be washed using water temperatures that are consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations. The washer and dryer should be wiped down with a hospital-approved disinfectant weekly or when visibly soiled. No special wash cycle is required for patients colonized or infected with multidrug-resistant organisms. 13. Contact Infection Prevention and Control for guidance (for instance, multiple cases of gastroenteritis in patients or staff within a short time period) whenever a cluster of infections is suspected.","A.

When should 12micron filters and tubing be changed and under what circumstances should the change frequency be adjusted,1,"1. Infusates (e.g., IV fluid, IV medications) are filtered based on infusate content, multiple infusions or patient diagnosis. 2. All parenteral nutrition (PN) solutions, including lipids, infused via central and peripheral infusions, are administered through a 1.2-micron filter. 3. Multiple medications running simultaneously into a single CVC lumen are filtered at the site closest to the patient. Single medication infusions, hydration fluid and peripheral infusions do not require a filter. Refer to the IV Filter Use reference tool for filter exceptions. 4. Intravenous fluids with divalent or trivalent electrolyte additives (e.g., calcium, and magnesium, phosphorous) are filtered. Monovalent electrolyte solutions (e.g., potassium or sodium) do not need to be filtered unless they are being co-infused with PN or as one of the multiple medication lines being administered simultaneously into a single CVC lumen. 5. Place filter as close to the IV catheter as possible. 6. Medications that are formulated as suspension or an emulsion cannot be administered through a 1.2-micron filter. Refer to the IV Filter Use reference tool or the Boston Children's Hospital Formulary for more information. 7. Blood products require a filter larger than 1.2 microns.

When the gauge of onboard oxygen and air read 500 psi, the tank is to be checked to assure it is turned on. Then the gauge is to be checked to see if the tank needs to be changed. If the tank is on, replace with a full tank. Check to assure it is full, turned on, and there are no leaks. 2. The oxygen tanks on the stretchers are to be changed when the gauge reads less than 1000 psi. The tank is then to be checked to assure it is full and there are no leaks. 3. The oxygen and air tanks in the isolettes are to be changed when the gauge reads less than 1000 psi. The tanks are then to be checked to assure they are full and there are no leaks. 4. The amount of spare oxygen and air tanks in the garage is to be checked on a daily basis. The gas technician is to be paged at pager# 1874 or through the Communications Center to bring refills of E and H size tanks to the garage to assure there is a sufficient supply of full tanks. During OFF hours, our team should have access to the gas supply room (2 nd floor receiving dock and the room is off to the right). 5. If size D tanks need to be replenished, check the dry erase board to see if they have been ordered. If not, notify the CCTT administrator to initiate the order with Air Gas East. Orders in before noon should arrive by next day. Write on the dry erase board and add to the crew chief sign out that tanks have been ordered. a. For reference: Air Gas East (#1-800-718-0685), Account# SDO72, PO# GENFD0000147635. 6. All tanks are to be checked and changed as necessary before known long distance transports. a. All empty or used D and E tanks should be secured in the red oxygen and air holder. The Gas tech should be notified to remove the empty tanks in order to maintain the appropriate par levels.","Sleep logs and ideally actigraphy may be obtained for 1 week prior to the MSLT to assess sleep-wake schedules. The patient's clothing should be comfortable, be appropriate to the environment, and not interfere with the performance of tests. A change in clothing is not required between the PSG and MSLT. The proceeding nocturnal PSG must allow a minimum 7 hours of time in bed with at least 6 hours of sleep, with timing that corresponds with the patient's major sleep period. The test should not be performed after a night during which PAP pressures were adjusted (split-night or PAP titration study). Patients on PAP/non-PAP therapies for sleep-disordered breathing should use them during the PSG and MSLT. The PAP settings and mask interface should match those used at home The patient should abstain from alcohol, caffeine, marijuana, and other sedating or alerting agents on the day of the test. Nicotine use is discouraged but if unavoidable should be terminated at least 30 minutes before a nap trial. Stimulating activities such as the use of electronic devices and the use of cell phones should end at least 30 minutes before each nap trial. Vigorous physical activity and prolonged exposure to sunlight/bright artificial light should be avoided all day. Standardization of test conditions is critical for obtaining valid results. Sleep rooms should be dark and quiet during testing. Room temperature should be set for the patient's comfort level. A light breakfast at least 1 hour before the first trial and a light lunch immediately after the termination of the second nap trial are recommended. Routine drug screening is recommended to ensure that sleepiness on the MSLT is not pharmacologically induced. Drug screening is usually performed on the morning of the MSLT but its timing and the circumstances of the testing may be modified by the clinician. Patient paperwork should include documentation of medications the patient is taking (dose and time taken), medications recently discontinued (what and when), habitual bedtime and wake time, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Instruct patient to complete the MSLT questionnaire after each nap (do you think you fell asleep/ dreamt) Sleep technologists who perform MSLT should be experienced in conducting the test. Stimulants, stimulant-like medications, and REM suppressing medications should ideally be stopped two weeks before MSLT. Use of the patient's other usual medications should be thoughtfully planned by the sleep clinician before MSLT testing so that undesired influences by the stimulating or sedating properties of the medications are minimized. Drug screening may be indicated to ensure that sleepiness on the MSLT is not pharmacologically induced. Drug screening is usually performed on the morning of the MSLT but its timing and the circumstances of the testing may be modified by the clinician. Deviations from ideal testing times and conditions (e.g, caffeine, nicotine, napping, cell phone, fire alarms, or other stimulating activities) should be documented by the sleep technologist.

Two readily deployable circuits are available for ECPR; a neonatal circuit for patients < 8 kg, and a pediatric circuit for patients >8 kg. The circuits are rapidly primed with PlasmaLyte-A, albumin, and heparin. Cannulae Selection Cannulae selection is determined by: • Route: Groin, neck, or chest • Surgical Technique: Cut-down or percutaneous • Type of ECMO support: VV, VVDL, VVV, VVA, or VA • Refer to ECMO Reference Tools . Pre-cannulation Considerations 1. The ICU Attending Physician, Fellow, or Nursing confirms: ◦ Clot present in blood bank ◦ Neurologic assessment (HUS for neonates) ◦ Venous and arterial access ◦ Plan for sedation and analgesia ◦ Review of outside ECHO (if available). 2. Nursing obtains: ◦ CBC ◦ Clot ◦ PT, PTT, Fibrinogen ◦ Electrolytes 3. Position patient for cannulation; infants are best positioned with head at the foot of the bed for neck cannulations. 4. Prepare medications: ◦ Routine resuscitation medications ◦ Heparin bolus of 75 units/kg ◦ Heparin 100 units/mL in D10W or D5W (total 50mL) for continuous infusion ◦ Hydralazine 0.1 mg/kg/dose IV ◦ 5% albumin ◦ Normal saline for fluid resuscitation ◦ Amicar if indicated ◦ Sedation and analgesia as ordered by the ICU Fellow or Nurse Practitioner ◦ Paralytic agent as ordered by the ICU Fellow or Nurse Practitioner Cannulation 1. A surgical team performs the cannulation procedure, and conducts a procedure ""time-out"" prior to incision. Refer to ECMO Time Out . 2. The ICU Team monitors and manages hemodynamics, airway, ventilatory support, and ensures sedation and analgesia during the cannulation procedure. 3. At the direction and discretion of the cannulating surgeon, the patient may receive a bolus of 75 units/kg of heparin prior to placement of cannulae. 4. Once cannulae have been secured, the ECMO circuit drainage and re-infusion lines are passed to the surgeon in a sterile manner and cut away from the ECMO priming reservoir. 5. The drainage, or venous line, is indicated with a blue marker and the re-infusion, or arterial line, with a red marker. Once a second time out is performed, and the surgeon verifies air-free connections, and the ECMO Specialist verifies that the lines are connected properly, the line clamps are removed and the ECMO pump is started.","• Monitor for hyperkalemia in all NICU patients but in particular in the following situations: ◦ Patients receiving exogenous potassium including maintenance IVF, intermittent infusions and routine supplements. ◦ Patients at risk for increased potassium release secondary to tissue destruction, trauma, cephalophematoma, hypothermia, bleeding, hemolysis, asphyxia/ischemia or intraventricular hemorrhage. ◦ Patients at risk for decreased potassium clearance as seen in renal failure, oliguria, or adrenogenital syndrome. ◦ Patients with miscellaneous associations including dehydration, acidosis, birth weight < 1500 grams, blood transfusions, and double volume exchange therapy. • The patient's clinical condition, ECG and actual serum potassium level all affect the choice of therapy for hyperkalemia. • The hyperkalemic infant may be asymptomatic or may present with a spectrum of signs including bradyarrythmias or tachyarrhythmias, cardiovascular instability or collapse. • ECG findings may include peaked T waves, prolonged PR interval with flat waves or widened QRS complex and if untreated may progress to supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. • When concerned about the possible diagnosis of hyperkalemia, the following laboratory tests are recommended: K + , Na + , Ca ++ , glucose, pH, pCO , pO 2 2","Resources Appropriate lab requisitions/ labels stamped with patient ID Appropriate blood tubes 3mL syringe Alcohol swabs Heparinized syringe for ABG and whole blood labs blunt cannula (open system) sampling cannula (closed system) syringes necessary for amount of blood needed Clean gloves Implementation 1.

An investigator's plan for pregnancy testing is to be consistent with the clinical guidelines unless a justified exception is approved by the IRB and the Department Chair or Division Chief. 2. Protocols may not exclude persons based upon their potential to bear children. There must be justified, scientific rationale to exclude persons of childbearing potential. 3. Massachusetts law requires that a positive pregnancy test result be communicated only to the minor and not to their parents without permission. This includes pregnancy test results obtained during the course of research. 4. The IRB sets an age criterion of 12 years or the onset of menses, as a requirement for pregnancy testing in protocols that may potentially affect a fetus. a. If an investigator proposes to perform pregnancy testing for children under the age of 12 or before the onset of menses, the investigator must justify why this is appropriate for the protocol. b. In determining whether it is acceptable to perform pregnancy testing before age 12 or the onset of menses, the IRB considers the potential for direct benefit offered by the protocol within the context of the research. 5. Adolescents under the age of 12 : For subjects under the age of 12 (if required by the protocol), the investigator is to use their discretion as to the subject's knowledge of and exposure to sexual activities in order to determine whether a separate document is reasonable. 6. Adolescents age 12 and older : The IRB strongly recommends that investigators consider the use of a separate document for adolescents age 12 and older, even when assent is not required by the adolescent. This document is to address pregnancy testing and the need to avoid pregnancy only. 7. Any plan for pregnancy testing must be fully disclosed in the informed consent document.

How do you calculate the plasma volume for FSGS patients in order to determine the amount to be treated during LDL Apheresis treatment,1,"Introduction This section of the SOP will describe the necessary steps for preparing for the treatment, and operating the Kaneka MA-03 to provide patient treatment. This includes: • Preparing for treatment/plasma volume calculation • Providing the treatment • Contraindications • Side effects Contraindications The Liposorber LA-15 must not be used with the following: 1. Patients who are being treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors; Severe anaphylactic reactions including shock have been observed in patients treated with the LIPOSORBER ® LA-15 LDL Adsorption Column under concomitant ACE inhibitor medication. Temporary suspension of ACE inhibitors is not sufficient to avoid severe reactions. 2. Patients with coagulation disorders such as severe hemophilia, severe hemorrhage diathesis, severe gastrointestinal ulcers, or who are receiving vitamin K antagonist medications after surgery 3. Patients who cannot tolerate extracorporeal volume shifts such as those with severe cardiac insufficiency, acute myocardial infarction, severe cardiac arrhythmia, acute apoplexy, or severe uncontrollable hypertension or hypotension 4. Patients with hypersensitivity to dextran sulfate cellulose, heparin or ethylene oxide. Side Effects • Hypotension • Nausea • Vomiting • Flushing • Angina • Fainting • Venous Access Problems Calculating plasma volume for FSGS patients 1. Determine plasma volume to be treated as follows 60mL/kg: STEP 1: a. Obtain patient weight in kilograms b. Multiply patient weight by 60 c. Round up value to the nearest hundredth. This is the plasma volume to be treated. EXAMPLE: 51kg x 60= 3060= 3100mLs","Step Action 1 Connect FD2 to Replacement Solution bag (LR) or (R) 2 Connect FD1 to Normal Saline on left of machine (new bag). 3 Calculate the plasma volume to be treated as follows (This may be performed any time prior to entering the operational settings. 4 Obtain the following patient information: • Gender (male or female) • Height (centimeters) • Weight (kilograms) • Hematocrit (%) 5 Refer to the appropriate table (male or female – in this SOP, following this page) and using the patient's height and weight, locate the factor (number) at their intersection. 6 Multiply the factor determined in above step by (100 – hematocrit). 7 Round the value from above step to the nearest hundredth. This is the plasma volume to be treated. 8 Touch the ""Treatment/Return"" key on the ""Procedure"" screen: Step Action 1 Confirm the IP syringe (anticoagulant) is placed. 2 Confirm the FD 2 line is connected to the Replacement (LRS) solution bag 3 Confirm the FD1 is connected to a 1000 ml of NS on left side of machine. 4 Set the blood flow rate of the Blood Pump (BP) by turning the knob and adjust as necessary for patient's access and tolerance. Watch P1 (arterial line) and P7 (venous line) pressures as a guide for raising pump rates. Do not exceed a blood pump flow rate of more than twice the patient's kilogram weight. For example: Patient weighs 25 kgs do not exceed Blood Pump rate of 50 mls/min 5 Set the fluid flow rate of the Plasma pump and the Replacement Fluid Pump by turning the knob of Plasma/Replacement ratio. Set the plasma flow rate as a percentage of the blood flow rate as tolerated by patient, not to exceed 30%. The replacement fluid rate should be the same as the plasma flow rate. 6 Touch the ""Change Data"" key on the LCD screen.

However, the PRA test is known to be rather nonspecific. Patients with a PRA greater than 10% will undergo further screening with the flow cytometry technique or antibody specific detection Luminex . Luminex uses a single antigen which detects high risk antibodies to Class I and Class II HLA. Treatment Options for Allosensitized Patients Plasmapheresis Plasmapheresis consists of the mechanical removal of antibodies from the circulating blood providing a means of decreasing the likelihood of allograft rejection. Plamaspheresis patients have the same rate of rejection and survival as those given IVIG therapy (7). Though, plasmapheresis is associated with higher infection rates than IVIG therapy. In the setting of transplantation, plasmapheresis provides a rapid method of decreasing circulating antibodies (7). Plasmapheresis is often combined with IVIG resulting in post-transplant outcomes similar to non-sensitized patients. Mechanism of action Plasmapheresis may also be referred to as therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). TPE can be performed either by blood particle element size or density. TPE separation by size is largely performed by filters but this method is not used in the United States. With the use of filters, whole blood flows over a membrane separating the plasma from the cellular elements. Cellular elements are then returned to the patient along with Blood Bank plasma (7). The most widely accepted method for TPE in the US is separation by centrifugation. Here the blood enters a continuous centrifuge where elements are separated by density. RBCs are the most dense and migrate furthest from the center of the centrifuge, followed by platelets, WBCs, and lymphocytes and granulocytes. Plasma is the least dense and remains more central. The plasma layer is then continuously discarded with the remaining layers transfused back to the patient. Plasma is transfused to the patient in conjunction with the process. The removal of any substance from the plasma is limited to the intravascular space during TPE. A formula to describe substance removal is: Y/YO = e –x = final concentration of substances circulating in the plasma YO = initial concentration of substances circulating in the plasma X = number of times the patient's plasma volume is exchanged e =the removal of a substance. Due to recirculation and dilution, all plasma is not removed. For every 1-1.5 plasma volumes exchanged, approximately 60-70% of plasma is removed. TPE is usually limited to 1-1.5 times the plasma volume since the benefits seen with further TPE are small and less clinically important. It is generally thought that further time for TPE results in increased risk without patient benefit. Considerations Anesthetics- protein bound. Special considerations should be discussed with anesthesia in order to maintain levels of anesthesia. IV Immunoglobulins Immunoglobin therapy has been used successfully to decrease allosensitization before cardiac transplant. Low dose immunoglobulin therapy has also been used in conjunction with plasmapheresis. Immunoglobulin administration works by binding circulating antibodies rendering them ineffective. Intravenous immunoglobulin has also been used alone to decrease the level of allosensitization prior to heart transplantation, especially in VAD recipients. Treatment with IVIG resulted in decreases in their PRA to levels below 10% within 4 months from administration (8). IVIG resulted in a mean reduction of 33% in anti-HLA Class I reactivity one week after treatment, with minimal side effects (8). Rituximab Rituximab is a medication used in conjunction to decrease allosensitzation. Rituximab depletes B- lymphocytes through complement-dependent cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, and induction of apoptosis causes the depletion of B lymphocytes in the circulation, lymph nodes, and bone marrow; with a moderate decrease in the PRA (8).

The bypass circuit is always primed with a balanced electrolyte solution first; Plasma-Lyte A 7.4 or Normosol (17). The primary crystalloid prime solution should have a heparin concentration of 3 units per milliliter before addition to the circuit. The prebypass filter must be removed before blood priming. 2. The primary perfusionist will determine the amount of blood required to prime the bypass circuit. 3. Calcium gluconate and sodium bicarbonate must be added per normal routine with a prime blood gas performed before bypass (this may not be possible in an emergency). 4. Refer to guideline 2.7, Priming the Perfusion Circuit for further details. 5. A standard blood prime will be documented in the standard fashion with bicarbonate, calcium and heparin levels added (along with antibiotic and steroids, etc.). 6. Time permitting, prebypass ultrafiltration (PBUF) should be performed. 7. PBUF primes should be documented using the ""PBUF RWB"" or ""PBUF PRBC"" buttons. a. The calcium and bicarbonate fields do not need to be filled out for the prime. The policy covers these values. b. The heparin should be included in the prime section. c. The ""Prebypass ultrafiltration of entire prime blood unit Yes/No"" button must be selected to save the form. This will help with future queries. d. Subsequent RWB blood administered will have the same profile as the documented PBUF prime blood. e. Only the heparin amount in future aliquot needs to be documented since the electrolytes and glucose, etc. are documented in the prime section. f. If the prime blood unit volume exceeds the circuit volume (450 ml RWB unit for a Choddler-400ml circuit), document the circuit prime volume only and follow up with the remainder as a volume add during the initial phase of bypass with a matching amount of ultrafiltrate volume removed.","Safety monitoring of infants during therapeutic hypothermia on transport.

What are the key components required to be discussed with the patient andor parentguardian before obtaining informed consent at Boston Childrens Hospital,0,"The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) regulations outline the basic general requirements of informed consent. 1. Informed consent be obtained for the subject or legally authorized representative. 2. Informed consent must be documented on a written consent form approved by the IRB and signed by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. Unless the IRB has approved a waiver of consent, the required elements or approved another method of obtaining consent as specified in the regulations. 3. The prospective subject or the legally authorized representative must be provided with information that: a. A reasonable person would want to have in order to make an informed decision about whether to participate; b. Is in language that is understandable; and c. An opportunity to discuss that information. 4. No informed consent may include any exculpatory language through which the subject or the legally authorized representative is made to waive or appear to waive any of the subject's legal rights, or releases or appears to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution, or its agents from liability for negligence. 5. Informed consent must be obtained before the initiation of any screening processes performed solely for the purpose of research. 6. HHS regulations require that informed consent must begin with a concise and focused presentation of the key information that is most likely to assist a prospective subject or legally authorized representative in understanding the reasons why one might or might not want to participate in the research. This part of the informed consent must be organized and presented in a way that facilitates comprehension. In general, Boston Children's Hospital will apply the key information summary requirement to all consent documents. If research is not under the jurisdiction, exceptions can be made on a case-by-case basis to not require a summary of key information","It is the policy of Boston Children's Hospital to comply with all federal and state regulations that pertain to informed consent. A key requirement of human subject protection is voluntary participation. Furthermore, the informed consent process must assure that the potential subject fully understands: 1. The research 2. What they are being asked to do 3. The associated risks and benefits of the research for which they are providing consent","The expectation of Boston Children's Hospital PI's in regard to informed consent are as follows, PIs: 1. Are responsible for obtaining and documenting informed consent in accordance with the regulatory requirements, unless otherwise waived by the IRB. 2. Are permitted to delegate to appropriate individuals the authority to obtain consent on their behalf; however, PIs are ultimately responsible. 3. Have an ethical responsibility to ensure that subjects and families understand through the informed consent process: a. the nature of the research participation b. the associated risks and benefits, and c. any alternatives. 4. Must take whatever steps are necessary to ensure this understanding and to facilitate implementation of a bona fide informed consent process. 5. Are to maintain informed consent documentation in a manner approved by the IRB.","The following is a summary of the justifications and steps that need to be taken in order to conduct emergency research protocols with a waiver of informed consent: 1. Protocol justification: Researchers must provide a detailed description in their protocol that: a. The human subject is in a life-threatening situation, available treatments are unproven or unsatisfactory, and the collection of valid scientific evidence is necessary to determine the safety and effectiveness of particular interventions; b. Obtaining informed consent is not feasible, for three reasons: i. Participation in the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the subjects, ii. The study could not practicably be carried out without the waiver of informed consent; and iii. The study defines the length of the potential therapeutic window and the investigator has committed to attempting to contact a legally authorized representative to ask for consent for each subject within that window of time. 2. Community consultation : Consultation with appropriate community representatives will need to occur before the research begins 3. Public disclosure : Appropriate public disclosure will need to occur prior to the initiation of the study as well at the completion of the study 4. Ongoing attempts to obtain consent : Researchers planning to conduct research that does not include the informed consent of all subjects must provide information and attempt to obtain the consent from the subjects and/or the appropriate relatives or legally authorized representatives on an ongoing basis throughout the conduct of the research and at the conclusion of the research. a. It is also required that information be provided about the clinical investigation to the subject's legally authorized representative or to a relative, if feasible, if the subject dies before consent has been obtained 5. Summaries of attempts to obtain consent : If obtaining informed consent is not feasible and a legally authorized representative is not reasonably available, investigators must document and summarize their attempts to contact family members to obtain their consent. a. This information will need to be submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing review. 6. A separate Investigational New Device (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) - if subject to FDA regulations : Protocols involving an exception to the informed consent requirement under this FDA regulation must be performed under a separate investigational new drug application (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE) that clearly identifies such protocols as protocols that may include subjects who are unable to consent. a. The submission of those protocols in a separate IND/IDE is required even if an IND for the same drug product or an IDE for the same device already exists. b. Applications for investigations under this section may not be submitted as amendments under 312.30 or 812.35. 7. Independent Data Monitoring Committee: An independent data monitoring committee will need to be established. a. Requests for research that fall within this emergency informed consent exemption often take longer periods of time to review, therefore investigators should plan ahead. b. Often, it will be necessary to arrange for meetings with the IRB Chair and administrative staff in addition to the IRB meetings. Other representatives from Boston Children's Hospital, such as public affairs may also need to be contacted and involved.","HHS (45 CFR 46.117(c)) and FDA (21 CFR 56.109(c)(1)) allow the IRB to waive written informed consent for research that meets specific regulatory criteria. 1. For HHS funded research (45 CFR 46.117(c)), the IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds either: a. That the only record linking the subject and the research would be the informed consent form and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. b. Each subject (or legally authorized representative) will be asked whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the research, and the subject's wishes will govern; i. That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context; or ii. If the subjects or legally authorized representatives are members of a distinct cultural group or community in which signing forms is not the norm, that the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and provided there is an appropriate alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained. 2. For FDA regulated research (21 CFR 56.109(c)(1)), the IRB may only waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds: a. That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context. 3. The investigator is required to justify in the protocol how the conditions for waiver of documentation are to be met. 4. The procedure for waiving the requirement for documentation is not intended to circumvent the requirement for informed consent but rather to protect patient privacy. All required information must still be presented and discussed to ensure a voluntary informed consent process. 5. In cases in which the documentation requirement is waived (referred to as ""obtained through a method other than a written document"" in Boston Children's Hospital IRB application and approval materials), the IRB will often require the investigator to provide subjects with written information about the research.",4,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

Electrophysiology Medication An EP medication challenge is a non-invasive diagnostic test that Challenge uses provocative medications given intravenously to induce arrhythmias, when they are not inducible at baseline. Cardiac resynchronization A CRT Echo is performing a sequence of echo images evaluating therapy (CRT)Echo ventricular function while simultaneously performing short term pacemaker changes and monitoring ECGs","The whole blood activated clotting time (ACT) is a screening test used to monitor clotting activity and heparin anticoagulation management during hemodialysis and CRRT therapies. The Hemochron ® Response measures the amount of time it takes a clot to form by means of a precision aligned magnet within a test tube and a magnetic detector located within a test well. When a test tube is inserted in to the test well of the Hemochron ® Response, its magnetic detector senses a magnet within the test tube as the tube slowly rotates. When a clot begins to form, it causes the magnet to be displaced and is no longer sensed by the magnetic detector. The instrument's timer stops, provides an audible signal and displays the coagulation time. A series of quality controls and associated procedures are conducted to verify the accuracy of the Hemochron ® Response and related testing materials.","Federal regulations also allow for certain types of studies to be exempt from the IND regulations. Per 21 CFR 312.2, Clinical investigations of a drug product that is lawfully marketed in the United States may be exempt from the requirements of the IND regulations, provided that all of the following conditions apply: 1. The study is not intended to be reported to the FDA as a well-controlled study in support of a new indication or use; or support any significant change in the drug's labeling; 2. The study is not intended to support a significant change in the advertising for a prescribed drug; 3. The study does not involve a change in route of administration, dosage level, patient population, or other factors that significantly increases the risks associated with use of the drug product; 4. The study complies with IRB evaluation and informed consent requirements; and 5. The study sponsor and/or investigator do not represent in a promotional context that the drug is safe and effective for the purposes in which it is under investigation. When research involves the use of a drug other than the use of a marketed drug in the course of medical practice, the regulations also provide for additional exemptions from the IND regulations: 1. A clinical investigation is for an in vitro diagnostic biological product that involves one or more of the following: Blood grouping serum, reagent red blood cells, anti-human globulin. a. The diagnostic test is intended to be used in a diagnostic procedure that confirms the diagnosis made by another, medically established, diagnostic product or procedure. b. The diagnostic test is shipped in compliance with 21 CFR 312.160 C. 2. A clinical investigation involving use of a placebo if the investigation does not otherwise require submission of an IND.

Testing Procedure Testing of biologic materials must be coordinated through ARCH. This provides consistency of testing and a repository for all test results. Research personnel must contact a member of the ARCH veterinary staff to arrange for shipment of the biological material to be tested. Testing takes approximately two weeks. 2. Important Points a. Many cell lines are purchased through what are considered to be ""reliable sources."" Unfortunately, these companies rarely test for rodent pathogens. Therefore, unless the vendor can supply documentation that indicates the results of the cell line testing, the cell line must be tested. b. Testing of biologic materials must take place through ARCH. This provides consistency of testing and a repository for all test results. c. In the laboratory, consider segregating materials to be used in vitro versus in vivo to minimize confusion. d. All protocols submitted to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) must describe the use of biological materials. e. Documentation of the test results must be reviewed by the Attending Veterinarian or designee as part of the protocol submission. f. If a viral outbreak has occurred in the room where animals are housed using this biologic, testing of the biologic must take place before it is reused, unless there is documentation to show the cell line is not contaminated. g. If a cell line tests positive for rodent pathogens, it may be possible to rescue this line by putting it in a non-permissive host. For example, a murine cell line contaminated with MHV could be placed in a (nude) rat. Rats are not a host for MHV, so they would grow the tumor and eliminate the pathogen at the same time, making it MHV free and able to be safely used in mice. The rescue may only be performed under an IACUC-approved protocol.",4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1

When tub baths are allowed, leave the old tape in place during bath. This will minimize the risk of inadvertent tube dislodgment and may aid in loosening the tape for removal. Before completing the bath, remove tape for cleaning. 2. Carefully remove the old dressing while ensuring the tube is stabilized. 3. Inspect GJ-tube site and surrounding peristomal skin. A small amount of drainage around the tube is normal. Note any peristomal skin irritation or rashes. Skin compromise may be due to gastric contents leaking onto the skin. Refer to Enteral Feeding Tube Troubleshooting Reference Tool for nursing interventions and consult Enteral Tube Service as needed. 4. Beginning on POD #2, wash the GJ-tube site daily with soap and water using cotton swabs, gauze, or a washcloth. Be sure to clean as close to the insertion site as possible. If there is crusty drainage present that is not easily removed with soap/water, then use ¼ strength hydrogen peroxide/water to clean the area. Rinse well with water after cleaning. Gently pat dry. 5. Do not rotate GJ-tube as rotation may cause j port to dislodge or kink. Instead gently shift tube no more than 15 degrees in either direction in order to assess the site for skin breakdown. The tube should lightly sit on the abdominal surface. There should be approximately a dime's width between the abdominal surface and the tube. Consult the Enteral Tube Service if tube appears too tight or if there is skin breakdown. 6. Apply a single layer of 2 x 2 gauze split gauze under the tube only if there is active drainage around the GJ-tube. If there is excessive drainage or skin irritation present, consider the use of a high absorbency dressing instead. Consult the unit skin SME or Enteral Tube Service for recommendations.

What is the specified header under which the procedures for handling original films are outlined in the hospitals policy document,0,"Outside Images that are not requested to become part of the patient's medical record When outside images are returned to the Radiology Image Service Center, they are to be mailed back to the appropriate hospital. If outside images are received by the Image Service Area, the proper destination for these films should be determined and brought or sent there. If the images are to be delivered to another location within the hospital, the location should be noted on the envelope and sent through interoffice mail. If the film is simply addressed ""Children's Hospital,"" a check will be made to see if the patient is an inpatient, in which case the films will be put in the inpatient file. If the images are to go to a radiologist, the film should be left for the supervisor to follow up the following day. Most other outside images are to be returned immediately to the proper hospital. The only exception to this is when incoming images are unaddressed. In this case, the images are placed in appropriate slot in the back area of the Image Service Center and kept for one month. On all envelopes, either write ""Return"" or attach a note on each envelope and place on shelf in the back of the Image Service Center. • A record is kept of every outside film returned. This log is separated into two categories: ◦ Massachusetts - alphabetically by cities ◦ Out of State - alphabetically by state, then subdivided alphabetically by cities of that state. With each film: ◦ Record name of patient ◦ Name and address of where films are being sent ◦ Date of mailing NOTE: The outside film log is kept on the shelf near the rear door of the Image Service Area. It is used to check addresses if they are not clear. There is often one page devoted entirely to a particular hospital. In these cases, nothing is entered under the city in general. If another hospital requests the return of their x-rays, the following are checked: ◦ Outside films to be returned ◦ Slot containing unaddressed outside films ◦ Log to see if they, in fact, have been returned ◦ Patient's CH film folder (if one exists) ◦ Check patient's reports (if they exist) as to the service of the patient, and contact the doctors or clinics to see if the films are there. If the images still cannot be found, fill in a form letter stating that the Radiology Department does not have the images, and any further information relating to the service of the patient would be helpful for a further search.

What is the purpose of a sepsis huddle and when should it be initiated according to the hospital policy,0,"1. The technologist running the board or in charge of the area should notify the attending radiologist(s) of the delay situation and should initiate a huddle to establish a plan for patient care. ◦ If there are anesthesia patients involved, the Radiology Nurse in Charge of that area and the anesthesiologist in charge should be involved in the huddle as well. If necessary, or if the situation does not improve, the Division Chief should be called. ◦ The attending radiologist should consider reviewing the protocols for the patients on the schedule and adjusting if appropriate. ◦ A communication plan should be established to inform families of delays and explain steps we are taking to minimize any further delays. ◦ Review staffing and assess if additional staffing is needed. ◦ Continued escalation up the chain of command within the department should be followed if needed. 2. No patient should be canceled because of the delays without the approval of the attending radiologist. Consider alternative plans of care as appropriate, including alternative modalities or locations. 3. Once a plan is devised, it is the responsibility of the lead persons to notify families of delays, explain steps we are taking to minimize any further delays, and facilitate resolution to problems that might be created by the delays (i.e. Parking passes, rescheduling, etc.). In general, the anesthesia patients will be taken care of by nursing and the non-anesthesia patients taken care of by technical staff.","• Notify senior resident (covering provider): with sepsis concern, unit, patient name, MRN, your name and call back number, request closed-loop communication via call back from responding provider 1 • Response: if no response to the page within 15 minutes, use chain of command (i.e. page Fellow, Attending) • Close loop : with responding provider by stating SBAR below and confirming that team member on their way 1 ( BEFORE calling the provider: evaluate the patient, notify Charge RN, complete a sepsis trigger tool and plan your SBAR.

The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for when it is appropriate to request a cost transfer and what is the allowable mechanism to do so for both personnel and non-personnel costs. 1. Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals and Other Non-Profit Organizations (OMB Circular A-110) prescribes that every institution in receipt of federal funds must maintain adequate financial management systems. The purpose of a financial management system is to facilitate programmatic decision-making. 2. There are a variety of appropriate mechanisms that can be adopted, at the departmental or laboratory level, that meet the federal standard for financial management systems. CHB requires that an appropriate method of grants management be maintained, which facilitates decision-making during the award period . Federal regulations recognize that the principal investigator is ultimately responsible for ensuring that all original transactions are appropriately and accurately charged to the correct project based on the benefit received on the project. Attributing costs to the appropriate project should be done prospectively. Therefore, the request for a cost transfer should only be required in rare circumstances. 3. The federal Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals (OASC-3) state that ""any costs allocable to a particular sponsored agreement under the standards provided in (OASC-3) may not be shifted to other sponsored agreements in order to meet deficiencies caused by overruns or other fund considerations, to avoid restrictions imposed by law or by terms of the sponsored agreement, or for other reasons of convenience."" Simply stated, cost transfers should be initiated to ensure expenses are aligned with the projects they benefit, not just as a means to correct over or underspending. CHB cannot allow cost transfers made for inappropriate purposes, but recognizes that there will be certain circumstances when cost transfers must be done to correct charges on sponsored projects. 4. The government also requires that cost transfers be done in a timely manner. Several government agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), state that cost transfers should be accomplished within 90 days. CHB has adopted this guideline and has defined the 90-day interval to begin with receipt by the Financial Manager of the run sheet listing the cost to be transferred. Thus, cost transfer forms should be submitted within 90 days of receipt of the run sheet. 5. Significant cost transfers delayed beyond 90 days without strong justification may be greeted skeptically by government enforcement and funding agencies. In addition, delays of greater than 90 days before requesting cost transfers result in a significant increase in the workload to carry out the transfer. Increased delays result in substantially more journal entries and computations that must be completed by both the departmental grants administrator and central fund accountant. 6. Investigators should therefore understand that significant cost transfers beyond 90 days, particularly absent a compelling excuse, may lead funding agencies to view them as careless, poor stewards or haphazard; may jeopardize a transfer which would have otherwise been unproblematic, leaving the investigator and department financially exposed; may prompt burdensome government inquiry; and in serious cases may affect their ability to receive government funds through the same or different programs. 7. Departmental Financial Managers should submit cost transfer forms to correct charges on sponsored projects being conducted in their departments. Transfers identified by Research Finance and carried out centrally within Research Finance do not require a Cost Transfer form from a department. Types of transfers initiated within Research Finance (RF) include: 1) transfers between expense categories on the same sponsored project; 2) transfers between two or more years of the same grant, and 3) removal of a deficit from a sponsored project to a contingency fund in the absence of a valid cost transfer request from the department. 8. Adherence to this policy is necessary, as a condition of conducting research at CHB. Investigators are responsible for complying with it, supervising their administrative staff in a manner that ensures that staff understand it and also comply, and seeking assistance from Research Finance where necessary or if they have any questions or concerns. 9. Roles and Responsibilities a. Principal Investigator and Financial Manager i. The Principal Investigator and Financial Manager are responsible for correctly charging costs to the appropriate projects, promptly correcting errors consistent with this policy, and providing an adequate explanation and taking appropriate remedial steps in the first instance to prevent delay in cost transfers. If a change is necessary, the Principal Investigator and/or Financial Manager will complete the appropriate forms as described in the above policy and procedure. b. Financial Analyst (Research Finance) i. The Research Finance office will review, approve and process all appropriate cost transfers. The Financial Analysts in Research Finance office will provide guidance to the research community for interpreting and complying with this policy and procedure. c. Vice President for Research Administration i. The Vice President for Research Administration, or designee, is responsible for evaluating and determining whether to approve requested Late Cost Transfers.",This policy and procedure describes the purpose and the protocol of how to create a hospital account in Epic. The hospital account must be created in order to assign insurance to the account. Without a hospital account- claims cannot be filed.,"1. What is the NIH GWAS Policy? This is a data sharing policy for GWAS. The policy establishes a NIH GWAS Repository that has two components: a. An open access portion that will be freely available to the public and will include: i. The protocol ii. Questionnaires iii. Variables measured, and iv. Other supporting documentation b. A controlled access portion that will only be available to researchers who have been approved by an NIH Data Access Committee (DAC). This portion will include: i. Coded phenotype, exposure, genotype and pedigree data 2. What is a Genome Wide Association Study? a. A genome-wide association study is one in which 100,000 or more SNP markers are tested in individual DNA samples. b. NIH also offers the following definition: ""To meet the definition of a GWAS, the density of genetic markers and the extent of linkage disequilibrium should be sufficient to capture (by the r2 parameter) a large proportion of the common variation in the genome of the population under study, and the number of samples (in a case-control or trio design) should provide sufficient power to detect variants of modest effect."" 3. When did the policy go into effect? The GWAS Policy went into effect for competing applications and new proposals submitted on or after January 25, 2008. 4. To whom does the policy apply? The policy applies to investigators who receive any NIH funding for genome-wide analysis of tissue specimens (GWAS). Of note, unlike the NIH data sharing policy that has a threshold of $500,000, the GWAS policy has no threshold – therefore, any NIH funding for GWAS triggers the policy. 5. When is the policy NOT triggered? The policy is not triggered if GWAS is conducted without NIH funds; even if the GWAS use specimens that were collected and/or stored with NIH funding",0,4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1

Complete the line history before activating the algorithm. 1. What happened immediately before the line occluded? ◦ Was IV fluid infusing? ◦ Was the line used for medication administration? ◦ When was the line last accessed/flushed? ◦ Was the line flushed with saline and/or heparin? ◦ Has the line occluded in the past? ◦ Was the line at risk of malposition (e.g., line pulled externally, recent dressing change, change in interthoracic pressure)? 2. If fluids only (no medications) were running: ◦ Was TPN infusing? If TPN, check with the Clinical Nutrition Service (CNS) to be certain that the concentrations of calcium and phosphorous are compatible and not prone to precipitation. Review the entire TPN formulation with the CNS to rule out other possible incompatibilities. ◦ If TPN solution, determine if the bag was allowed to become excessively warm (i.e., placed on top of any infusion pump/under warming lights/inside an isolette). ◦ Were lipids also being infused? If so, were they: 1. co-infused into the same IV line as PN or 2. infused through a different access site? ◦ Was the solution a TNA solution (e.g., TPN mixed with lipids in one bag) brought in from the patient's home? 3. If medications were given prior to occlusion: ◦ Which medications were given? ◦ Determine the concentration and length of infusion. ◦ How was the medication diluted for administration? (Determine diluent type & volume) ◦ Was a filter used? 4. Was there a filter in place? ◦ Did the filter occlude? How was it treated? The Pharmacist will help to determine what caused the precipitate in the filter and correct the situation. In some instances, it may be necessary to remove a clogged filter and replace prior to resuming the infusion.

For example, research that involves the use of an investigational drug will likely require that a physician member of the research team obtain informed consent. 5. Who is best able to answer the questions that may come up? It may be advantageous to have two individuals involved in the consent process. 6. Often the investigator provides information, and a research nurse is made available to follow-up and provide additional information. 7. If an individual other than the investigator is obtaining consent, is the investigator available if questions arise? Who can spend as much time with the families as they require. If an investigator is also the family's physician, can the family distinguish the different roles?",1. Purpose a. To provide a sterile perfusion circuit for all patients undergoing extracorporeal circulation. Aseptic technique is used to minimize the risk of introducing pathogens into the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit in order to protect the patient from hospital acquired infections. Dry circuit may be used up to 30 days after the documented set up time on the heart-lung machine.

The technologist running the board or in charge of the area should notify the attending radiologist(s) of the delay situation and should initiate a huddle to establish a plan for patient care. ◦ If there are anesthesia patients involved, the Radiology Nurse in Charge of that area and the anesthesiologist in charge should be involved in the huddle as well. If necessary, or if the situation does not improve, the Division Chief should be called. ◦ The attending radiologist should consider reviewing the protocols for the patients on the schedule and adjusting if appropriate. ◦ A communication plan should be established to inform families of delays and explain steps we are taking to minimize any further delays. ◦ Review staffing and assess if additional staffing is needed. ◦ Continued escalation up the chain of command within the department should be followed if needed. 2. No patient should be canceled because of the delays without the approval of the attending radiologist. Consider alternative plans of care as appropriate, including alternative modalities or locations. 3. Once a plan is devised, it is the responsibility of the lead persons to notify families of delays, explain steps we are taking to minimize any further delays, and facilitate resolution to problems that might be created by the delays (i.e. Parking passes, rescheduling, etc.). In general, the anesthesia patients will be taken care of by nursing and the non-anesthesia patients taken care of by technical staff.","The key word or phrase should be the specific topic of the webpage.

If there is a significant change in the patient's condition that would reasonably be expected to alter the treatment plan or require additional procedures (that was not identified or discussed with the patient as part of the initial consent), a new consent may need to be obtained for the subsequent treatment. • For outpatient services, the consent remains in effect throughout the course of continuing services, provided the patient is continuing the same or similar recommended procedure, intervention, or treatment for the same initial diagnosis. There is a general standard that a consent should be reviewed and updated on an annual basis to determine if the course of treatment or evaluation being provided has changed since the initial consent was signed. • When the treatment plan involves recurrent treatments and procedures, a consent is not required for each repetitive treatment/procedure, unless there is a significant deviation from the original plan, the patient's condition or diagnosis changes from the initial intent of the consent (which was not something identified or discussed with the patient and/or the parent/guardian as part of the initial consent form), or different treatments are being provided during the recurring treatment plan. • There is no specified or standard time period in which a consent should be obtained prior to a procedure. If the provider's practice is that the consent is normally obtained at a specified period prior to the planned procedure, intervention or treatment, (e.g., one week, one month, longer) the provider should maintain those practices.","1.

How often is the program for annual education around signs and symptoms of TB provided to all staff,0,• Occupational Health Services and Infection Prevention and Control review the program and perform risk assessment annually. • Staff with history of positive TB test will need to complete the Symptom Analysis Questionnaire annually. • All staff will receive annual education around signs and symptoms of TB.,"1. All employees, Medical Staff, volunteers and Associated Personnel receive baseline screening following CDC recommendations before beginning work. a. Anyone with a baseline positive result, must provide one chest radiograph result to exclude current TB disease and documentation of treatment for latent TB infection. Repeat radiographs are not needed unless symptoms or signs of TB disease develop or unless recommended by a clinician. 2. Any staff member with newly positive results is referred to the Boston Public Health Department- sponsored TB Clinic for further management. 3. CDC no longer recommends routine annual TB screening for healthcare workers. Occupational Health Services conducts annual symptom screening for selected employees and staff who are known to have a history of latent TB infection (LTBI), and may at their discretion choose to perform screening for an individual employee or staff member known to be at especially high risk based on exposures. Education about risk factors for TB and signs/symptoms of disease, as well as instructions to contact Occupational Health Services if these symptoms are present, is included in annual employee computer-based training.","1. Transmission of TB is a recognized risk in healthcare facilities. Transmission is most likely to occur from patients or their parents and visitors with unrecognized pulmonary or laryngeal TB who are not receiving effective anti-TB therapy and have not been placed on Airborne Precautions in a negative pressure isolation room.

What are the potential risks associated with transfusing red blood cells with high potassium levels and how can these risks be minimized,1,"1. The transplant coordinator and/or transplant physician/surgeon discuss potential medical risks with the patient or parent/guardian. These risks include, but are not limited to: a. wound infection; b. pneumonia; c. blood clot formation; d. organ rejection, failure or re-transplantation; e. lifetime immunosuppressant therapy; f. arrhythmias and cardiovascular collapse; g. multi-organ failure; and h. death. 2. The transplant social worker assesses all transplant candidates. The psychologist and/or psychiatrist evaluates transplant candidates on an as needed basis. Theses clinicians discuss potential psychosocial risks with the patient or parent/guardian. These risks include, but are not limited to: a. depression; b. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD); c. generalized anxiety; d. anxiety regarding dependence on others; and e. feelings of guilt. 3. The patient or parent/guardian is also informed that future health problems related to transplantation may not be covered by his/her insurance carrier, and if applicable, alternative financial resources are discussed and explored. The patient or parent/guardian is informed prior to the patient's placement on the waitlist that it is the patient or parent/guardian's responsibility to keep insurance current and understand coverage requirements. This information is provided by the financial coordinator. 4. The discussions above occur early in the evaluation process and again with any change in the patient's medical or psychosocial condition. Appropriate referrals into the patient's community are made as needed. 5. Patient or parent/guardian signature on the informed consent form indicates understanding of potential medical and psychosocial risks and is placed in the patient's medical record.","1. If the administration of blood is necessary when potassium levels are elevated, packed red blood cells should first be processed in the cell saver. 2. Conventional and zero balance ultrafiltration may be used to control the circulating potassium level. With the removal of plasma water, potassium and other electrolytes are also removed. Normal saline should be added to reduce the amount of circulating potassium and replace needed volume as needed. This should be done until the circulating potassium level reaches an acceptable value (generally 3.50-5.50 mmol/L). a. Note: Normal Saline is used to avoid the addition of additional potassium associated with Plasma- Lyte A. 3. Be attentive during the administration of cardioplegia. Monitor the serum potassium level frequently. 4. Monitor the serum sodium levels. The serum sodium level may increase with the addition of the sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate which is used to neutralize the effect of crystalloid administration. Sodium chloride has a pH of 4.5 to 7.0. The addition of the sodium chloride may cause an acidosis that will need to be treated with sodium bicarbonate. This also may increase the serum sodium level. The serum sodium level should be maintained at 135-148 mmol/L. The surgeon should be informed if the sodium level exceeds 150 mmol/L. Zero-balance ultrafiltration with half normal saline may be used to help control the sodium level per discussion with the anesthesiologist and/or surgeon. 5. Communicate with the anesthesiologist to determine if diuretics should be administered. 6. Glucose and insulin may be administered on bypass under the direction of the attending anesthesiologist. Be aware that this regimen may take up to 20 minutes to be effective","The IRB must determine that the risk to the subject is minimized by implemented procedures that are consistent with sound research design and that do not expose the subject to risk unnecessarily. In evaluating the risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from the risks and benefits of therapies the subject would receive even if not participating in the research). The risk will be reviewed in relation to the benefit the subject will receive. In general, the higher the risk the greater the benefit one would expect. The IRB will also consider potential risks to a community that may result from the research for examples stigmatization. The IRB will not consider the long-range effects of applying the knowledge gained in the research as among those risks or benefits that fall within the purview of its responsibility. 1. Are the risks and benefits well described? 2. What is the probability and magnitude of the risks? 3. Have the risks been minimized and potential benefits maximized as much as possible? 4. Has the possibility of unknown risks been addressed? 5. Are there appropriate monitoring procedures to identify risks? 6. Are there appropriate mechanisms to address risks if they occur? 7. Should the period of initial approval be less than one year in order to monitor for potential risks?","Bank blood is known to have nonphysiologic values for many electrolytes which can lead to an undesirable effect on hemodynamics once transfused (1-4). Cell saver washing of PRBC units has been shown to effectively control mediators of hemodynamic change seen with stored blood (2,5). Though, increased cell wall fragility and hemolysis after processing and during bypass may be seen (5,6). This can lead to excess free iron in the blood which has been associated with negative outcomes (7-12). Prebypass ultrafiltration can be used to correct known issues with bank blood for patients requiring a blood prime in the bypass circuit (13-16). Standard 13.2 in the 2019 AmSECT Pediatric and Congenital Standards and Guidelines states that, ""When priming with exogenous blood, a circuit prime gas and electrolyte levels shall be obtained prior to initiation of bypass and adjustments made to correct any physiologic abnormalities"" is a standard which shall be perfomred (17). Additionally, guidelines 13.1 and 13.2 state that. ""When priming with exogenous blood, the use of prebypass ultrafiltration (preBUF) or washed red blood cells should be used during priming procedure"" and ""the perfusionist should consider matching prime composition to the individual patient values"" (17). These two guidelines should be given strong consideration. The PBUF policy aims to meet the standard and if indicated, the guidelines as well.","• Diuretic therapy, e.g. furosemide, may increase K+ excretion by increasing flow and Na+ delivery to the distal tubules, the primary site of net K+ secretion. ◦ In the setting of inadequate urine output, peritoneal dialysis and/or double volume exchange transfusion are potentially life-saving options. The former has been accomplished successfully for infants< 1000 grams and should not be excluded if the patient's overall clinical status and etiology of hyperkalemia suggest a reasonable chance for good long term outcome. ◦ With double volume exchange transfusion, fresh whole blood (<24 hours old) or deglycerolized red cells reconstituted with fresh-frozen plasma should be used; aged banked blood may have potassium levels as high as 10-12 mEq/L. Theoretically, aged, washed packed RBC will have acceptable potassium levels. • The enhancement of K+ excretion by the use of cation exchange resins such as sodium or calcium polystyrene sulphonate has been studied primarily in adult renal failure patients. Administer these resins orally/per gastric tube or rectally. ◦ Possible complication of resin administration includes colonic necrosis and bowel obstruction secondary to bezoar or plug formation. ◦ The gastric administration of either Ca+ or Na+ polystyrene sulphonate is not recommended in preterm infants with hypomotility due to concerns regarding excessive gastro intestinal concentration. ◦ The PR administration of Kayexelate with a minimum retention time of 30 minutes should be effective in lowering serum K+ by approximately 1 mEq/L. Insert the enema to 1-3 cm using a thin silastic feeding tube. Kayexelate prepared in water or normal saline and delivered PR should be a therapeutic agent with an acceptable risk/benefit ratio.

How does Boston Childrens Hospital encourage the identification and reporting of adverse events by its staff,0,"Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) is committed to effectively responding to events that are reported by staff along the continuum from near misses to sentinel events and to promote a culture of safety and transparency. To achieve these goals, Boston Children's Hospital has established policies for the internal reporting, classification, response, external reporting, and disclosure of events. Adverse events and adverse drug events are those defined by this policy, occurring in any location on the BCH licensed premises, consistent with applicable state and federal laws and regulations. The hospital has educational processes in place that encourage the identification and expected reporting of such events by any member of the hospital's staff.","[URAC P-PSC 1-3 (a)] It is Boston Children’s Hospital policy to treat suspected or potential adverse reactions as adverse reactions, therefore the same procedure would be followed for both. A. A standardized reporting mechanism will be employed: 1. All ADEs will be referred to the Specialty Pharmacy Manager for appropriate follow-up; 2. Adverse event reporting will be documented through the hospital’s internal web-based Safety Event Report System (SERS) within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. a. Any hospital employee, volunteer, Medical Staff member, or House Staff member may report an adverse event. b. If staff are uncertain whether an event is a reportable adverse event staff should err on the side of reporting. 3. All clinically significant ADEs will be communicated to the prescribing physician (or attending physician if the prescriber is not available) immediately as well as submit a SERS within 24 hours of becoming aware of the adverse drug event; 4. If the ADE is an ADR, new information (i.e., a new allergy or adverse reaction) must be immediately documented as a coded medication in the patient’s medical record in the allergy/adverse reaction section. B. Criteria for reporting an event through SERS: 1. Events to be submitted through SERS include: a. Any occurrence of an adverse event, any near miss, an event, or situation that places at patient at increased risk of harm, or unplanned significant change in medical or surgical management not related to the patient’s underlying condition b. While the adverse event (and clinically relevant patient information resulting from the event) is documented in the patient’s medical record, the SERS report is maintained separate from the medical report for review purposes. c. Staff should report any unsafe conditions for patients or staff through SERS. C. Completed forms will be routed according to policy and procedure: 1. The Pharmacy Director of Safety & Quality & the Specialty Pharmacy Manager will be notified within 24 hours. D. The responsibility for investigating and responding to events resides with PPSQ (Program for Pharmacy Safety and Quality) but may be delegated to the individual or department reporting the event for events of lower severity and that are not externally reportable. In all cases, the response to an event is dependent upon the nature and severity of the event. E. ADEs are presented and summarized monthly to the Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T) Committee for review and recommendations for action needed. F. The Pharmacy Director of Safety and Quality and the Specialty Pharmacy Manager shall meet quarterly to discuss any ADEs during the quarter or the discussion will take place during quarterly QMC meetings. A detailed analysis shall be compiled which may include a plan of correction and a process for quality improvement. G. On at least a quarterly basis, report aggregate findings, including adverse drug events and errors, to the Quality Management Committee or other quality oversight body responsible for quality management. H. The pharmacy will contact prescribers to inform them of serious (SERS level 3-5) adverse events reported by patients or caregivers. I. Boston Children’s Specialty Pharmacy will report serious and unexpected adverse drug events to appropriate external entities such as Med-Watch and to the drug manufacturer (if contractually obligated). [URAC P-PSC 1-3 (a)] Adverse events are reported externally in accordance with applicable state and federal laws and regulations, and hospital policy. J. All follow-up activities and reports shall be monitored by the Pharmacy Director of Safety and Quality and the Specialty Pharmacy Manager for a period of one (1) year following initiation of the plan of correction.","Following the identification of an adverse event, the first priority is the mitigation of harm to the patient and appropriate communication with the family. The responsibility for investigating and responding to events resides with PPSQ, but may be delegated to the individual or department reporting the event for events of lower severity and that are not externally reportable. In all cases, the response to an event is dependent upon the nature and severity of the event. Responses to an adverse event may include, but are not limited to: • Activation of the Safety Event Rapid Response Team (SERRT) • Investigation: Initiation of an investigation and causal analysis of events is undertaken by PPSQ staff and/ or local leaders, depending on the nature and severity of the event. The approach seeks to identify system failures that contributed to the adverse event. Techniques employed may include: ◦ Root Cause Analysis (RCA) ◦ Apparent Cause Analysis (ACA) ◦ Clinical practice concerns of an individual clinician (MD or RN) may be referred to the Medical Peer Review or Nursing Peer Review process. Issues identified related to individual trainees will be referred to the appropriate training program director. ◦ When appropriate, relevant patient outcomes and adverse events may also be reviewed at Divisional or Departmental Morbidity and Mortality (M&M) conferences, consistent with the M&M Policy. ADEs are presented and summarized monthly to the Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T) Committee for review and recommendations for action if needed.","BCH performs pre-placement post-exposure health screens to ensure employees are fully vaccinated, screened for TB and physically able to perform their job duties prior to starting employment. BCH has established safety assessment and management processes that identify known and potential adverse impacts of buildings, grounds, equipment, occupants and internal physical systems on the safety and health of patients, staff and other people at the Boston Children's Hospital facilities. These processes involve integrating knowledge of identified hazards, in order to select and implement procedures and controls to minimize the potential for adverse impact on the safety and health of patients, staff and other people coming to the Boston Children's Hospital facilities. BCH has implemented an automated system for the reporting of patient safety events and uses the data from this process in addition to other sources of information to evolve effective patient safety programs and safety training materials. All potential hazards are ranked in this assessment from high to low, based on probability of occurrence and severity of outcome.","[URAC P-PSC 1-3 (a)] A. The goals of this policy are: 1. To have a positive impact in improving patient care; 2. To focus attention on understanding the causes that underlie the event; 3. To reduce the probability of a reoccurrence of the event in the future; and 4. To increase the general awareness and enhance strategies for prevention. B. When an adverse event occurs in a health care organization, it is necessary that the appropriate individuals in leadership positions within the organization be made aware of the event; investigate and understand the causes that underlie the event; and make changes in the organization's systems and processes to reduce the probability of such an event in the future. These leaders are responsible for establishing processes for the identification, reporting, analysis, and prevention of adverse events and for ensuring the consistent and ongoing implementation of a root cause analysis. C. Adverse Events that are subject to review by advisory boards and accrediting bodies include: 1. An occurrence or event which results in an unanticipated death; or 2. An event in which major and permanent loss of function (not related to the natural course of the patient's illness or condition) occurs. D. When such an event occurs the Specialty Pharmacy Manager, or their designee, is expected to prepare a thorough and credible root cause analysis and action plan within forty-five (45) calendar days of the event or of becoming aware of the event. The organization may submit the written analysis and plan to its accrediting body at its discretion and as advised by their legal counsel. E. The responsibility for investigating and responding to events resides with Program for Patient Safety and Quality (PPSQ), but may be delegated to the individual or department reporting the event for events of lower severity and that are not externally reportable. In all cases, the response to an event is dependent upon the nature and severity of the event F. Responses to an adverse event may include, but are not limited to: 1. Activation of the Safety Event Rapid Response Team (SERRT) 2. Investigation: Initiation of an investigation and causal analysis of events is undertaken by PPSQ staff and/or local leaders, depending on the nature and severity of the event. The approach seeks to identify system failures that contributed to the adverse event. Techniques employed may include: a. Root Cause Analysis (ACA) i. The RCA (including internal discussions, analysis, and corrective actions related to clinicians) is considered peer review protected information that is approved by the Senior Clinical Leadership Committee (SCLC). b. Apparent Cause Analysis (RCA) i. E.g. Precursor or Near-Miss events c. Clinical practice concerns of an individual clinician (MD or RN) may be referred to the Medical Peer Review or Nursing Peer Review process. Issues identified related to individual trainees will be referred to the appropriate training program director. d. When appropriate, relevant patient outcomes and adverse events may also be reviewed at Divisional or Departmental Morbidity and Mortality (M&M) conferences, consistent with the M&M Policy. G. If applicable, the Specialty Pharmacy Manager will conduct a root cause analysis which includes the following elements: 1. Focuses primarily on systems and processes, not on individual performance; 2. Progresses from special causes in clinical processes to common causes in organizational processes; 3. Repeatedly digs deeper by asking ""why?"" and then ""why?"" again; 4. Identifies changes which could be made in systems and processes that would reduce the risk of such events occurring in the future; and 5. Is thorough and credible. H. Boston Children’s Specialty Pharmacy, as it provides patient/consumer care in the delivery of medications, utilizes the FDA Med-Watch criteria in establishing its definition and reporting requirement of adverse events. [URAC P-PSC 1-3 (a)] 1. The following are reportable adverse events: a. Death - when a medication causes death or contributed to the death of a patient; b. Life-threatening - when a medication may have resulted in the death of a patient if use of the medication had continued; c. Hospitalization - when the medication caused or contributed to the hospitalization of a patient; d. Disability - when a medication may have caused or contributed to a permanent injury or impairment of the patient; e. Intervention - if medical or surgical intervention was necessary to preclude permanent damage due to the use of the medication. I. Adverse events will be reported to a supervisor or other clinical/administrative leader(s) as well as the hospital’s internal web-based Safety Event Reporting System (SERS) within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. The Specialty Pharmacy Manager will be notified when a reportable adverse event occurs, and appropriate action will be taken. The first priority is mitigation of harm to the patient and the appropriate communication with the family. All adverse events will be reported to the Quality Management Committee for review and analysis.",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
How does the hospital handle patient safety events and complaints and what reporting systems are in place for these incidents,0,"BCH has established processes for reporting and follow up of safety events, accidents and near miss events that involve patients, employees, visitors and others at the Hospital. There are three primary processes for reporting events: • Safety Event Reporting System (SERS) • Employee Accident Report • Security Incident Report The Safety Event Reporting System (SERS) provides direct, standardized entry of data in a structured format: efficient communication of events to the clinical leaders (designee) and the Program for Patient Safety and Quality; rapid identification of events requiring additional follow up and/or analysis; efficient production of standardized and customized reports for department/programs and the Hospital. The PSQ Patient Safety Managers and Project Manager oversee and administer the SERS. Pertinent safety event reports are summarized and reviewed at Safety Committee, as necessary. The Employee Accident Report (EAR) process provides the framework for investigating actual or potential work-related injuries. The completion of the Employee Accident Report provides the documentation from which the BCH Occupational Health Services Department develops a ""First Report of Injury"" form required by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The nature, type, and extent of injuries/illnesses are tracked to identify trends that may trigger further investigation. Injury investigations are coordinated and/or conducted with the Environmental Health& Safety Department to identify both ""apparent"" and ""root"" causes of injury causing processes or conditions. Work-related injury data is analyzed; trends and corrective action plans are presented to the Safety Committee, Executive Health and Safety Committee as well as respective departmental leadership. This year, we are transitioning to an electronic injury reporting system, called the Employee Safety Event Reporting System (E-SERS). The same employee safety reporting process will be followed, but will be reported on a computer instead of on paper. The Security Incident Report provides for the monitoring of all security-related incidents involving patients, employees, visitors, and other people at the Hospital grounds or facilities. The reports are recorded by the Security Department, summarized by number and type of incident, and reported to the Safety Committee quarterly.","1. The Children's Hospital Corporation (doing business as ""Boston Children's Hospital"" – hereinafter referred to as ""BCH"") is committed to providing the best possible care to every patient and family, and raising the bar for the quality and safety of pediatric health care for all of our patients. 2. Through the work of the BCH Program for Patient Safety and Quality (PPSQ), BCH constantly measures our performance to continuously improve what we do. BCH also works hard to make sure that practices reflect the latest science, while responding to the unique needs, preferences, and values of our patients and families, every step of the way. 3. When it comes to specific conditions and treatments, BCH believes that measurement is essential for providing world-class care. a.

What are some examples of patient conditions that would necessitate the use of a postpyloric feeding tube according to the hospital policy,1,"• Obtain a Gastroenterology (GI) consult prior to discharge to establish follow-up, and discuss a plan for replacement of tube when needed. • In general, if oral intake is expected to improve over the first year of life (for example, feeding immaturity related to prematurity or aspiration), nasal tubes may be a viable option for discharge to home, after discussion with the family. ◦ Pros: Avoidance of surgery/laparoscopy, temporary nature of the tube ◦ Cons: Tubes prone to dislodgement, need to maintain tube on the face, nasal congestion/obstruction from the tube • Patients are generally discharged with a post-pyloric tube (versus NG) if they improved with inpatient post-pyloric feedings, and/or continue to have severe illness that prompted the original placement of the post-pyloric tube (e.g. respiratory, neuromuscular, or GER), especially if being transferred to a rehabilitation facility (versus home). • Specific considerations for home post-pyloric feeding that should be discussed amongst the medical team, GI consulting service, and family are: ◦ Replacement of dislodged post-pyloric tubes does not occur at home, in a clinic, or in most locals Emergency Departments. The infant would likely need to present to the BCH ED to replace the tube via fluoroscopy. ◦ Post-pyloric feeds run continuously, over a majority of the hours per day, which may complicate activities, especially in the outpatient setting.","1. See Authorized Medication Administration policy. 2. Check orogastric or nasogastric tube placement according to the Patient Care Manual: Insertion of Indwelling Nasogastric Feeding Tubes . Do not check placement of post-pyloric tubes. 3. Verify that enteral feeding tubing is attached to enteral route. 4. Prepare the medication. Use liquid preparations whenever possible. Crush and dissolve tablets to a fine powder using a Silent Knight® or single-patient use pill crusher. If able to remove the contents, mix the contents of a hard or soft gelatin capsule with water if a liquid form is not available. 5. Mix powdered medications with water until fully dissolved before administering into the enteral tube. 6. Administer medication via enteral syringe. 7. When preparing doses from floor stock products, for small volumes, use an appropriate sized syringe and medication straw (required for 0.5 mL-3 mL ENfit™ syringes) when drawing up the medication to ensure accurate dosing. 8. Assess exit point marking on the enteral tube prior to medication administration; refer to the Insertion of Indwelling Nasogastric Feeding Tubes policy. 9. Flush the tube with sterile water between medications and after the last one to prevent occlusions. Consider patient’s fluid allowance; refer to Enteral Tube Flushing Guidelines. Sticky or viscous medications may need a larger volume of sterile water flush to clear the tubing.","Some medical and surgical conditions warrant special consideration by the physician/nurse practitioner before NG/OG tube placement. The NP/MD should weigh the risks and benefits of tube placement for patients with these conditions. In some cases, the tube requires placement under direct visualization by a NP/MD. These conditions include but are not limited to: • patients s/p pyloroplasty • patients s/p endonasal transsphenoidal surgery Consult the primary team caring for any patient with a history of gastrointestinal (GI) anomalies prior to insertion. The NP/MD places the NG/OG tube or is required to be present during placement. Medical or surgical conditions warranting special consideration include but are not limited to : • cerebrospinal fluid leak through the nose • immediate post-operative craniotomy or craniofacial surgery • new post-operative repair of upper GI anomalies (e.g., tracheoesophageal fistula, esophageal atresia) • esophageal varices • active upper GI bleeding • facial trauma/basilar skull fractures • new post-operative repair of cleft palate or pharyngeal flap","1.

What documentation is required from the HSCT intake attending regarding the recipients performance status and remission status in the EMR prior to receiving donor lymphocyte infusion,0,"1. Upon receipt of a request for a patient needing lymphocyte collection for CAR T-cell therapy, the HSCT Cellular Therapy Coordinator (CTC) sends an email to the referring health care provider requesting a summary of the patient's medical history and reason for stem cell collection. 2. A HSCT intake attending and a Hematologic Malignancy (HM) attending is identified. If the attending physicians agree that lymphocyte collection is indicated, the referring provider sends a complete medical summary to the accepting team, including the HSCT and HM attending physicians and the CTC. This summary documents the patient's treatment course to date, central venous catheter access (if applicable), and includes any pertinent infectious history. a. If appropriate as determined by the physicians, the referring physician provides documentation that the patient has had evidence of CD19+ disease based on flow cytometry of either a bone marrow or peripheral blood sample, in the event blasts are present in peripheral circulation, within in 60 days. 3. The CTC works with the referring provider and the patient's family to coordinate the patient's initial apheresis evaluation. 4. The referring provider is responsible for having an introductory discussion with the patient and family regarding the process of apheresis. a. The patient's initial contact with the accepting team is with the HSCT intake MD or Advanced Practice Provider (APP) for the apheresis intake visit. Consent for lymphocyte collection by apheresis is collected at this time. b. At this time the risks/benefits and process of lymphocyte collection is reviewed c. The patient has a physical examination and pregnancy test if applicable and all IDMs are drawn 5. The HSCT, HM attending or APP sends the following information to the CTC, who relays this information to the apheresis unit: a. Estimated date of collection b. Treatment protocol (if applicable) c. Date of last chemotherapy administration before apheresis collection d. Date of double lumen CVC placement and facility where CVC was placed if a previously placed CVC will be used to process blood for the collection. If CVC is placed at an outside hospital facility, a chest x-ray documenting adequate placement is required i. If a patient is >/= 10 yo and does not have adequate venous access for outpatient apheresis, an evaluation of patient's peripheral veins is arranged by the CTC to occur in the Therapeutic Apheresis Unit. e. Location where counts will be drawn and/or VNA contact information, if applicable f. Patient co-morbidities 6. If applicable, the CTC contacts the facility and/or Visiting Nurse (VNA) drawing the patient's counts in advance of the expected date of collection and arranges for appropriate blood draws. Patients who will not have counts drawn by a referring institution or VNA, will be scheduled by the CTC to come to Jimmy Fund Clinic for lab draw. 7. Patients who require placement of a temporary collection catheter will be admitted to the Hematologic Malignancy (HM) service following catheter placement. a. Catheter placement will be requested by the HM attending, by the HSCT attending, APP or designee when the patient has been referred from an outside center. i. The Peri Procedure form for temporary catheter placement states proceduralist should contact the TAU for the information on the catheter size and type to be placed. b. The CTC will schedule the admission for apheresis c. The HSCT attending will email or otherwise communicate with the admitting HM team to outline the patient's plan for collection d. Apheresis will supply the appropriate catheter to the operating room (if needed). 8. Once it is determined that a patient's lymphocyte counts are adequate for collection, the primary HSTC attending will communicate this to the CTC, who determines if the patient's apheresis exam and IDMs have fallen outside of the mandated time frame: a. If the apheresis exam is within 7 days prior to collection, and IDMs are within 7 days prior to collection, the CTC notifies the patient/family to go directly to the Jimmy Fund Clinic (JFC) or Apheresis Unit the morning of collection when patient has adequate venous access for an outpatient collection. b. If the apheresis exam falls outside of 7 days prior to collection and/or IDMs fall outside 7 days prior to collection, the CTC will schedule repeat blood collection for IDMs and apheresis exam by provider including pregnancy testing (if applicable) and will direct the patient/family to report the JFC on the morning of collection prior to reporting to apheresis. 9. The assigned HSCT attending physician writes a processing order in BOE 10. A pre-collection lymphocyte count (CD3 count) is drawn and resulted within 7 days prior to collection. Patient will require additional laboratory testing on each day of collection prior to collection: a. CBC with Diff b. ICa++ c. Blood Type and Screen 11. At the completion of each day of collection, the apheresis nurse and the HSCT attending physician receive the final cell count from the cell-processing lab. The HSCT attending determines if the cell count target has been achieved. The apheresis nurse then notifies the patient/family if they need to return for an additional day of collection or the HSCT attending notifies the inpatient HM team if the patient will require another day of collection.",• Immunodeficiency patients being evaluated as an outpatient in the Jimmy Fund Clinic: ◦ Immunology will provide a comprehensive patient summary ◦ Patients will receive standard transplant evaluation in the Jimmy Fund Clinic by HSCT attending assigned by Program Director after formal consult requested by Immunology attending ◦ HSCT intake attending will outline the pre-HSCT testing and labs required for workup ◦ HSCT patient coordinator will schedule the pre-HSCT workup ◦ HSCT intake attending will review all pre-HSCT workup results ◦ HSCT intake team will be responsible for coordination of pre-HSCT testing and evaluation of potential related donors • Immunodeficiency patients being evaluated while inpatient on the Immunology Inpatient Service: ◦ Immunology will provide a patient summary ◦ Patients will receive transplant evaluation on the inpatient unit by HSCT attending assigned by Program Director. ◦ HSCT intake attending will outline the necessary pre-HSCT workup in a consult note ◦ Immunology resident will be responsible for ordering required labs and tests ◦ HSCT patient coordinator will be responsible for collecting the results of the pre-HSCT workup ◦ HSCT intake attending will review all pre-HSCT workup results and notify the team of any changes or additional testing needed ◦ HSCT intake team will be responsible for coordination of pre-HSCT testing and evaluation of potential related donors. ◦ HSCT intake attending will round periodically on inpatient Immunology patients being evaluated for HSCT to remain up to date on the patient's clinical status and leave a consult note to facilitate communication with inpatient team • For all Immunodeficiency patients being evaluated for HSCT: ◦ HSCT intake team will be responsible for dealing with obtaining insurance or embassy approval for transplant,"1. An intake transplant attending physician evaluates the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) typing (Class I and II) of patient and family members. HLA typing must have been performed by an American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogentics (ASHI) accredited laboratory. 2. If the transplant patient does not have an appropriate match within the family or a prospective donor within the family does not meet donor selection criteria, the patient is discussed at weekly comprehensive patient review meeting with unrelated donor search coordinators (URD), financial counselor, and medical and nursing representatives regarding initiation of an unrelated donor search. 3. HSCT attending requests a preliminary search through World marrow Donor Association (WMDA) and/or National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) via the URD search coordinators. 4. The American Red Cross (ARC) Tissue Typing Laboratory performs class I and II high resolution HLA typing on the recipient and donor specific antibody testing when applicable per Evaluation of Stem Cell Transplant Patients Prior to Admission for Stem Cell Transplant (SCT) 5. After the financial coordinator obtains insurance approval or other search assistance programs, the URD search coordinator initiates a formal search through the NMDP 6. The Hematopoietic Stem cell Transplant (HSCT) attending physician(s) and the URD search coordinator regularly review the status of the donor search at weekly comprehensive patient review meeting. 7. Initial selection criteria for prospective donors include but are not limited to: ◦ Degree of match ◦ Donor availability/Response to request for confirmatory sample ◦ Donor age ◦ Donor gender ◦ Donor CMV status ◦ Donor parity (if applicable) ◦ Geographic location ◦ DPB1 status 8. Other criteria (e.g. EBV status, umbilical cord blood cell dose) may be applied where available/ appropriate. 9. After a potential donor has been selected, and the donor center has granted medical clearance, the HSCT attending evaluates any further laboratory information communicated by the NMDP or other registries. a. Umbilical cord blood products will only have eligibility and licensure status provided 10. NMDP will provide ABO group, RH type, infectious disease markers (IDM) panel and additional labs as requested a. Umbilical cord blood products will include a detailed report including maternal IDMs and additional information related to the cord blood unit 11. All donors have HLA typing performed/confirmed by the American Red Cross (ARC) a. Umbilical cord blood products will have confirmatory typing completed via an NMDP contracted lab or cord blood bank. ▪ If confirmatory typing cannot be performed on attached segment, request will be made to test any additional cord blood material. If no material available to send for confirmatory typing, a different donor option is pursued. If use of umbilical cord blood unit is requested without confirmatory typing, this must be documented as a planned derivation as approved by the Medical Director of Quality. 12. All donors must have two HLA tests performed at separate times. At least one typing must be completed at the American Red Cross and be high resolution. a. Umbilical cord blood products will be HLA typed per NMDP or cord blood bank. For chimerism, a segment may be sent to American Red Cross for HLA typing at time of processing 13. HLA typing may be determined by NGS, SSO or PCR methods. 14. All donors have high resolution DNA based testing performed at the following loci: A, B, C, DRB1, DRB3/ 4/5 and DQB1, DPB1. a. An 8/8 matched donor is a donor matched to the recipient at A, B, and DRB1 at high resolution DNA based typing b. A 10/10 matched donor is a donor matched to the recipient at A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 at allele level high resolution DNA based typing c. Recipient planned for receipt of mismatched stem cell product requires HLA antibody screen per Evaluation of Stem Cell Transplant Patients Prior to Admission for Stem Cell Transplant (SCT) (sample document) 15. After final selection of donor/umbilical cord blood products by HSCT attending physician, URD coordinator requests collection/shipping dates. a. URD search coordinator will communicate confirmed donor workup and collection plan or umbilical cord blood product shipment date to the clinical team 16. The date the selected donor is available to serve as donor is confirmed. 17. Family is informed of donor status and date of transplant. 18. Eligibility status will be communicated by the URD search coordinator when final determination is available. If selected donor is ""ineligible"" or ""incomplete"" according to FDA standards the HSCT attending may still elect to use this donor. Appropriate labeling of product, patient and/or guardian notification, signed consent ( Permission to Receive a Product with Increased Risk Factors (PIRF) ) and dictation of consent process is required. 19. HSCT attending signs final HLA typing report documenting final donor or umbilical cord blood product selection. 20. Donor medical clearance is needed prior to start of patient conditioning, donor mobilization or donor collection; whichever occurs first 21. Patient conditioning cannot begin until medical clearance for the donor has been given, or until umbilical cord blood product has arrived at DFCI cell processing laboratory. Confirmation of umbilical cord blood product arrival is sent to medical director and/or HSCT attending via e-mail. 22. URD coordinator arranges the process by which product is delivered to Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) 23. Any critical change in patient or donor availability status is immediately communicated to the recipient clinical care team and URD search coordinator program director as per Late Cancellation of Planned Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT).","Toxoplasmosis 1.

What are the considerations for documenting adequate sleep before conducting the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test MWT,0,"1. In preparation, the clinician and the patient should define goals for adequate sleep regarding timing and duration. 2. Adequate sleep should be documented by sleep diary and, whenever possible, actigraphy for 2 weeks before testing. 3. The MWT should be conducted when a patient is clinically stable and when treatments of any known sleep disorders are well-established and effective. 4. In patients with sleep-disordered breathing who are being evaluated for the effectiveness of therapy, the clinician should ensure effectiveness (efficacy and adherence) based on a review of downloaded data or self-reported use for non-PAP before testing. If adequate effectiveness is suboptimal, then the clinician should determine if the anticipated impact on the test results warrants rescheduling. The patient should use PAP/non-PAP therapy on the night before the MWT. 5. The clinician should develop a plan regarding the use of prescription medications, OTC agents, herbal remedies, and other substances. If the patient is chronically taking medications with alerting or sedating properties, then they should be continued at a stable dose. Changes in medications should be avoided for 2 weeks before testing. The patient should be instructed to consult with the clinician before starting a prescription or OTC medication before the test. 6. The patient's use of tobacco, caffeine and medications before and during MWT should be determined by the sleep clinician before the MWT. The patient should abstain from alcohol, marijuana, and other sedating substances on the day of the test. Drug screening may be indicated to ensure that sleepiness or wakefulness during the MWT is not influenced by substances other than medically prescribed drugs. The physician may request a urine specimen for drug screening; the timing of this specimen is determined by the physician. 7. Relevant clinical data such as preceding sleep schedules, PAP adherence, or other therapies should be available to the interpreting clinician.

What are the vital signs that should be monitored noninvasively during cardioversion defibrillation and pacing procedures,1,"1. May be found in patients with prior life-threatening episodes of ventricular arrhythmias. Capable of delivering a number of therapies including: a. Anti-tachycardia (""overdrive"") pacing b. Single or dual chamber pacing for bradycardia c. Cardioversion d. Defibrillation e. Adaptive rate sensors 2. AICDs are usually implanted subcutaneously in the abdomen or left chest. 3. Malfunction may lead to failure to defibrillate in the presence of an abnormal rhythm, or administration of countershocks when not indicated. 4. Whenever possible, obtain a 12-lead ECG at the referring hospital for review by the cardiology service. DO NOT DELAY transport to obtain a 12-lead ECG; instead, it is acceptable to record tracings from limb leads (I, II, and III). 5. In addition to usual patient history, obtain the following information if able: a. Device capabilities and programmed settings – see Appendix 1: Implantable Pacemaker/ AICD Nomenclature Information Sheet b. Date of last battery change c. History of delivered shocks in recent past d. Name and contact information for patient's EP Cardiologist e. Pertinent history that may be contributory to ICD malfunction (i.e.: hit in the chest area of implant, exposure to power source) 6. For patients with AICD failure and presence of a rhythm for which defibrillation or cardioversion is indicated, perform defibrillation or cardioversion using the energy doses provided above in the Cardioversion and Defibrillation section. Avoid placing the defibrillator paddles/ pads over the AICD device. 7. For patients with AICD malfunction who are receiving defibrillations that are not indicated, consult with the Medical Control Physician. With authorization from the Medical Control Physician, place a magnet over the AICD to disable it. The magnet should be kept in place for the duration of the transport. Be prepared to perform transthoracic defibrillation or cardioversion if indicated. Do not place the defibrillator paddles/ pads over the AICD device. 8. Strong electrical fields may interfere with AICD performance. Precautions to be taken in the transport environment include: a. Cell phones should be kept > 6 inches from patient's implant site. b. Patient should not be subjected to MRI or radiation therapy doses of radiation. Dosing used for plain radiographs is permissible. c. Airport metal detectors may be set off by the device and hand wands may interfere with device performance. Team members should request a hand search of any patient with an AICD who needs to clear airport security.","1. Assess ABCs. Perform airway management according to the CCTT Airway Management protocol and initiate oxygen therapy or positive-pressure ventilations with 100% oxygen according to the CCTT Respiratory Distress/Failure protocol .

Phospholipids are the substances that makeup the cell membranes, including the lining of blood vessels. Etiology is unknown. APS causes the formation of blood clots in the vasculature, blocking blood flow, causing ischemic organ damage (3). Diagnosis tests involve screening for any presence of the three APS antibodies: anticardiolipin, beta2 glycoprotein I (β2GPI), and lupus anticoagulant. Mechanisms for the hypercoagulable effect of aPL antibodies include the following • Production of antibodies against coagulation factors, including prothrombin, protein C, protein S. • Activation of platelets to enhance endothelial adherence • Activation of vascular endothelium, causing binding of platelets and monocytes • Reaction of antibodies to oxidized low-density lipoprotein, thus predisposing to atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction (MI) • Complement activation Patients with catastrophic APS (CAPS) are generally very ill; consideration of the following is used as treatment modalities. • Plasma exchange • Rituximab • Plasmapheresis Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) One-third of patients on the transplant list test positive for HLA antibodies (5). Sensitization to HLA antigens occur when being exposed to non-self HLA such as during pregnancy, blood transfusion, prior transplantation and certain VAD implants (5). As a result, preformed antibodies cause decreased compatibility. HLA antibody levels are required in order to evaluate the risks faced by sensitized recipients and also to present strategies for desensitization. Testing for HLA Antibodies Cyto Antibody Screening Although there are many different antigens, there are six, which have been identified as having an important role in transplantation. HLA Class I molecules (A, B, C), and HLA Class II (DR, DP, and DQ) Class I MHC molecules are present as transmembrane glycoproteins on the surface of all nucleated cells. Class II MHC molecules are usually present only on Ag-presenting cells -B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, Langerhans cells","1.

Inspect dialyzer for cracks and sterility. Maintain aseptic technique throughout the procedure. 2. Place the dialyzer vertically into the dialyzer holder. The arterial blood port is at the top of the dialyzer. 3. Prepare the arterial and venous blood sets according to the accepted procedure for each set. 4. Thread the blood pump in the blood pump segment. 5. Using aseptic technique, connect the arterial line to the arterial blood port at the top of the dialyzer. 6. Connect the venous line to the venous blood port at the base of the dialyzer. 7. Rotate the dialyzer so that the arterial blood port is now at the base of the dialyzer. This position facilitates air removal from the dialyzer. 8. Use the standard priming solution, 1 liter of NS, and aseptically spike with clamped IV set. 9. Connect the primed IV set to the priming port on the arterial line. 10. Gravity prime the portion of this set between the priming port and the end cap and clamp this line. 11. Place venous line in an empty 'Prime Only' jug. Take care to avoid contamination of the set. Priming 1. To prime, adjust the pump speed to 150mL/min. 2. Invert the arterial post pump drip chamber until full at the start of the priming procedure to avoid the transmission of air into the dialyzer. 3. When saline reaches the venous drip chamber, adjust the level to ¾ full and continue priming until 1 liter of priming fluid has been infused. 4. To purge the air from the blood side of the dialyzer, intermittently clamp and release the arterial line just before the arterial blood port of the dialyzer to create surges of pressure in the arterial header cap. Continue this procedure until fibers in the dialyzer are free of air bubbles on visual inspection. Tapping the headers and positioning the blood ports upwards also assist in air removal. 5. After at least 1 liter NS has infused through the dialyzer, recirculate the primed circuit by joining the patient ends of the arterial and venous lines (using the arterial end connection piece as a 'bridge' piece) and adjusting the blood pump speed to at least 150mL/min. a. Open the IV NS line to compensate for any ultrafiltration occurring during re-circulation. 6. Continue recirculation without dialysis machine Hansen connectors, place machine in test mode when alarm free. 7.

What is the purpose of the document 21 Controlled Substpdf in relation to the pharmacy,0,"Security of Controlled Substances in a locked container or area 1. Controlled Substances are maintained in a secure manner, and in applicable settings within a locked container or area. The sole exception is for controlled substances under the direct control of the clinician involved in the immediate administration of the drug. Refer to the Controlled Substances policy for further details. Access to Controlled Medications 1. When the OR or the Procedure suite is in use, licensed and authorized clinical staff may access and temporarily store medications in badge-accessed locked drawers in carts immediately prior to, during and immediately following procedures. Clinical staff will follow proper disposal after use as outlined above. 2. If access to any Unit is not restricted to authorized personnel, medications are kept in a cart, cabinet or individual procedure room to which access is controlled or which is locked if not in active use (e.g., awaiting a scheduled or emergency case, being used for a case, or during turnover or cleanup from a case). Authorized Personnel with Access to Areas with Controlled Substances and Medications 1. Members of the medical, dental, nursing, pharmacy staff, medical and dental house staff, pharmacy students, respiratory therapists, radiology technologists, nuclear medicine technologists, cardiac perfusionists, anesthesia/OR technicians and other licensed clinicians approved by the medical staff with patient care responsibilities are authorized to have access to controlled substances and/or medications in the secure and locked containers/areas. ◦ Clinical assistants may transport non-federally controlled substances. A log will be kept in the pharmacy. ◦ Environmental services, dietary technicians, engineering, distribution or supply chain, security staff, and/or assistive personnel who have gone through BCH personnel security review and have signed the Medication Area Access Agreement for Non-Licensed Personnel , are authorized to enter the secure area only for the limited purposes to perform their assigned duties within the secure room. 2. Visitors (including technical consultants and drug and equipment manufacturer representatives), medical students, and nursing students when under the direct supervision or in the presence of a medical or clinical staff member are also authorized to enter the secure area for the limited purpose of their assigned duties. 3. Government and accreditation organization representatives when they are performing their regulatory responsibilities are authorized to enter the secure area.","Refer to the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Manual: Medication Storage, Security and Authorized Individuals. A pharmacy technician or pharmacist completes delivery of controlled substances to or from the pharmacy. • In some cases, controlled substances must be returned to pharmacy for appropriate disposition (e.g. patient own supply waste, soon to expire medications). Contact Pharmacy for removal. Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) and Epidural pump keys are stored in the Pyxis Medstation. These keys are considered a controlled substance and if lost, the event is treated as a discrepancy. If the key was removed from the hospital campus in error, contact the Pharmacist on Duty and activate the chain of command. Immediately analyze any discrepancies noted. Report an unresolved discrepancy and/or suspected or witnessed diversion of any controlled substance immediately to the Charge Nurse, Pharmacist on Duty, and activate the chain of command as indicated. If indicated, contact security, file a SERS Report for unresolved discrepancies, and notify the Program for Patient Safety and Quality (PPSQ) of all unresolved discrepancies and/or loss of controlled substances within 24 hours . Unresolved discrepancies are handled according per policy (Adverse Events - Response, Reporting, Disclosure ) Inventory of all controlled substances in Pyxis is conducted by two licensed clinicians weekly. Areas without Pyxis conduct a perpetual inventory per the Controlled Substances: Manual System. Complete controlled substance monthly audits within 30 days of receiving Pyxis data from pharmacy.","• Any unexplained loss or discrepancy should be reviewed within the context of Boston Children’s Hospital activity and environment. What constitutes a significant loss for one area may be construed as comparatively insignificant for another. • A SERS is filed within 24 hours of the discovery of loss or discrepancy per the Adverse Event Reporting Policy. • Initiation of an investigation of events is undertaken by pharmacy leadership and the Controlled Substance Safety Officer (CSSO) with coordination and notification to the Patient Safety Manager (PSM). The pharmacy and/or local area leaders will work to find the lost controlled substance or to validate the variance/loss. Pharmacy leadership will determine if the loss or discrepancy is reportable to the MA Department of Public Health or other state level agencies per the External Reporting of Adverse Events Policy. ◦ If pharmacy leadership determines the loss is not reportable, they will communicate this to the PSM for approval of no reportability. ◦ If pharmacy leadership determined there is a controlled substance loss, theft, suspected tampering, pharmacy leadership will draft the drug incident report form: ▪ The pharmacy leadership will complete the narrative section with the following considerations to standardize the report: ▪ General overview of the loss - 3 sentences maximum ▪ Add a statement, if applicable, that ""a thorough search was conducted of the work area did not locate __(the specific drug loss) "" ▪ Add a final statement of “A review of (pyxis machine or work station or pharmacy area)____ did not identify any concerning activity around discrepancies related to the area. Further, there are no trends or patterns of concern identified related to the individuals associated with this event.” ◦ The form is then sent to the Controlled Substance Safety Officer for review. ◦ After the CSSO has signed off, pharmacy leadership will send the report to the PSM for dissemination and review pursuant to 105 CMR 700.005(D). ◦ The MA DPH website houses the most up to date versions of the reporting form (use the pdf version): https://www.mass.gov/controlled-substance-loss-reporting • Once pharmacy review and approval occurs, pharmacy leadership will send the PSM for review within 5 days of the date the SERS was initially filed. • Once reviewed, the report is sent by the PSM to Chief Quality & Safety Officer, EVP Patient Care Operations & System CNO & Executive Vice President and General Counsel , with copies to the Vice President of Patient Safety, Quality & Regulatory Affairs , Director of Clinical Regulatory Compliance & Patient Safety , Manager of Patient Safety, Associate Medical Director for Patient Safety , Associate General Counsel. ◦ All final reporting to state level agencies is completed by PPSQ. • The Chief Pharmacy Officer or their designee will determine if the loss or discrepancy is also reportable to the DEA using the following criteria: The DEA website contains guidance on when to use DEA Form 106 to report theft or loss. The following is the relevant information for registrants: DEA wishes to stress that the DEA Form 106 and related guidance should be used only to document thefts or significant losses of controlled substances. Minor inventory discrepancies, not attributable to theft, should not be reported to DEA or recorded on a DEA Form 106. Rather, registrants should make appropriate notations of minor inventory discrepancies in their records, indicating the amount or variance between the physical count and the amount accounted for through records. Such discrepancies need not be reported to DEA if they are not significant or actual losses. If a registrant is unsure of the significance of a loss after considering the factors described below, the registrant should file the report. Any continuing pattern of loss of seemingly insignificant quantities should always be considered significant. When determining whether a loss is significant, consider, among others, the following factors: 1. The actual quantity of controlled substances lost in relation to the department and area 2. A pattern of such losses, and the results of efforts taken to resolve them; and, if known, local trends and other indicators of the diversion potential of the missing material Specific questions which a registrant should ask to identify whether a loss is significant include, but are not limited to: 1. Has a pattern of loss been identified? 2. Would this pattern result in a substantial loss of controlled substances over that period of time? 3. Are specific controlled substances being lost, and do the losses appear to be random? 4. Are the specific controlled substances likely candidates for diversion? 5. Can losses of controlled substances be associated with access to those controlled substances by specific individuals? 6. Can losses be attributed to unique activities which may take place involving the controlled substances? When in doubt, registrants should err on the side of caution in alerting the appropriate law enforcement authorities, including DEA, of thefts and losses of controlled substances.","It is not always possible to eliminate all pain. However, techniques are available that make pain reduction to an acceptable level a realistic goal in the majority of circumstances. Whenever possible behavioral and non- pharmacological interventions should be used in addition to analgesics to optimize pain management. These include: • Consoling • Heat and cold • Repositioning • Massage • Relaxation • Exercise and/or immobilization • Distraction • Preparatory information • Music, art and play therapy • Calming environment • The supportive presence of a parent or other family member Effective pain relief requires flexibility in dosing, the ability to deliver the dose to the patient ""on demand"", regular monitoring of the adequacy of analgesics and of any drug related side effects and the use of these parameters to individualize. PCA and NCA are two ways to facilitate this process. The purpose of a loading dose of opioid prior to PCA initiation is to raise the plasma concentration of opioid to the therapeutic level needed before the smaller PCA doses can provide analgesia.","☐ Maintain effective IND 1.

According to the hospital policy what are some examples of procedures or treatments that do NOT require a consent form,0,"• Absent a medical emergency, the following procedures, interventions, or treatments listed below require a written consent form: ◦ Administration of blood or blood products (if the patient and/or the parent/guardian has not approved its use as part of the written consent) ◦ Chemotherapy ◦ For Non-Oncology Chemotherapy, the need for consent is guided by the matrix found on the pharmacy website. ◦ Circumcision ◦ Experimental procedures or treatments ◦ Genetic Testing (asymptomatic) ◦ Moderate sedation, deep sedation and general anesthesia ◦ Organ Donation ◦ Radiation therapy ◦ Sterilization ◦ Termination of Pregnancy (special form required and special rules apply; consult with BCH Attorney on Call) ◦ All surgical or other invasive procedures . Examples of surgical or other invasive procedures includes: ▪ Biopsy ▪ Major percutaneous aspiration of body fluids through the skin (e.g., bone marrow aspiration, lumbar puncture, paracentesis, thoracentesis, suprapubic catheterization) ▪ Cardiac procedures (e.g., cardiac catheterization, pacemaker implantation) ▪ Central vascular access device insertion (e.g., Swan-Ganz catheter, percutaneous intravascular catheter (PIC) line, Hickman catheter) ▪ Major dermatology procedures (e.g., biopsy, incision and drainage of abscess, excision and deep cryotherapy for malignant lesions) ▪ Electrocautery of skin lesion ▪ Major endoscopy (e.g., J-tube placements, nephrostomy tube placements) ▪ Interventional radiology procedures (e.g., percutaneous biopsy) ▪ Invasive ophthalmic procedures (e.g., procedures involving implants) ▪ Major laser therapy ▪ Major oral surgical procedures (e.g., permanent tooth extraction and gingival biopsy) ▪ Podiatric invasive procedures ▪ Renal Dialysis ▪ Skin or wound debridement performed in an operating room ▪ Skin incision or puncture including, but not limited to: open surgical procedures, percutaneous aspiration, selected injections, biopsy, percutaneous cardiac and vascular diagnostic or interventional procedures, laparoscopies, and endoscopies. • Examples of procedures or treatments that do NOT require a consent form ◦ Venipuncture, arthrocentesis, arterial lines in the ICU, intravenous therapy, simple laceration repair, minor dermatological procedures performed in outpatient settings.","• For inpatient services, consent is valid for the duration of the hospital stay, both during and following the procedure, intervention, or treatment. If there is a significant change in the patient's condition that would reasonably be expected to alter the treatment plan or require additional procedures (that was not identified or discussed with the patient as part of the initial consent), a new consent may need to be obtained for the subsequent treatment. • For outpatient services, the consent remains in effect throughout the course of continuing services, provided the patient is continuing the same or similar recommended procedure, intervention, or treatment for the same initial diagnosis. There is a general standard that a consent should be reviewed and updated on an annual basis to determine if the course of treatment or evaluation being provided has changed since the initial consent was signed. • When the treatment plan involves recurrent treatments and procedures, a consent is not required for each repetitive treatment/procedure, unless there is a significant deviation from the original plan, the patient's condition or diagnosis changes from the initial intent of the consent (which was not something identified or discussed with the patient and/or the parent/guardian as part of the initial consent form), or different treatments are being provided during the recurring treatment plan. • There is no specified or standard time period in which a consent should be obtained prior to a procedure. If the provider's practice is that the consent is normally obtained at a specified period prior to the planned procedure, intervention or treatment, (e.g., one week, one month, longer) the provider should maintain those practices.","HHS (45 CFR 46.117(c)) and FDA (21 CFR 56.109(c)(1)) allow the IRB to waive written informed consent for research that meets specific regulatory criteria. 1. For HHS funded research (45 CFR 46.117(c)), the IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds either: a. That the only record linking the subject and the research would be the informed consent form and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. b. Each subject (or legally authorized representative) will be asked whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the research, and the subject's wishes will govern; i. That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context; or ii. If the subjects or legally authorized representatives are members of a distinct cultural group or community in which signing forms is not the norm, that the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and provided there is an appropriate alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained. 2. For FDA regulated research (21 CFR 56.109(c)(1)), the IRB may only waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds: a. That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context. 3. The investigator is required to justify in the protocol how the conditions for waiver of documentation are to be met. 4. The procedure for waiving the requirement for documentation is not intended to circumvent the requirement for informed consent but rather to protect patient privacy. All required information must still be presented and discussed to ensure a voluntary informed consent process. 5. In cases in which the documentation requirement is waived (referred to as ""obtained through a method other than a written document"" in Boston Children's Hospital IRB application and approval materials), the IRB will often require the investigator to provide subjects with written information about the research.","• A provider can amend or change any information that is included in the informed consent form prior to a patient signing the form. • As the signed informed consent document is part of the patient's medical record, any changes that are necessary after it has been signed should occur in the same manner as amending information in the patient's medical record.

Please note that there are two signatures lines for the provider: ◦ The provider obtaining consent signature is for those providers within the same department (e.g., attending physician, fellow, resident, APRN, PA) who reviewed the form with the patient prior to a procedure, treatment, or intervention. The purpose of this signature is to assist with those circumstances where the primary provider may be unable to obtain the consent in advance. ◦ The primary provider signature is required prior to the start of any procedure, treatment, or intervention. i. Please note, the primary provider performing the service may be the only provider who discusses the case with the patient (parent/guardian) and therefore only the primary provider signature is completed – both signature lines are not necessary to begin a service. ii. The goal is that the Primary Provider should sign the form after having met with the parent/ guardian and/or the patient. However, if circumstances (emergency, parents/family not available, DCF custody) arise where the primary provider is not be able to meet with family prior, the primary provider should still sign based on the parent (guardian) and/or patient signing the form in advance with a provider obtaining consent. iii. The Primary Provider is an attending, fellow, resident, or advance practice clinician with approved privileges from the department to perform the service(s). 5. The signed written informed consent should be submitted to HIM to be scanned into the patient's medical record. Note: if the form is not signed because of a medical emergency or refusal to consent, document the nature of the medical emergency or circumstances of the refusal in the patient's medical record.","Complete patient care documentation as described in the Patient Care Manual. In addition, document in the patient's medical record and orders if applicable. If consent is obtained, a copy of the signed informed consent form is placed in the medical record. A notation is made on the patient outcome sheet.","1. Informed consent documents must always be readily accessible. Therefore, where the research is pertinent to clinical care by Boston Children's Hospital or Boston Children's Hospital physicians, investigators must maintain copies of the original informed consent document in research records as well as the medical record. 2. In the event commercial sponsors require the original informed consent document to be filed with a research binder, the Medical Records Department will accept a copy of the subject's signed informed consent in lieu of the original. In order to determine the manner of storage, it is important to understand sponsor requirements prior to initiating a study. 3. Investigators also must take into consideration the possibility that a consent document could be misplaced and not make its way to the medical record. For that reason, investigators may choose to store the original consent in their research records.",4,4,3,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

Why is it important for a Communications Specialist to maintain continuity and accuracy in dispatching transport calls,0,"• A single Communications Specialist receives and relays information to and from the Transport Team, and any other medical personnel involved in the transport. • Purpose: To maintain continuity and accuracy in dispatching transport calls.","The Communications Specialist (CS) that initially takes a transport request will be the CS that relays information to and from the Transport Team, the Medical Control Physician, and the referring facility. 1. The Communications Specialist that initiates the transport request will be the CS that communicates with the team throughout the transport. 2. If the CS who is handling a transport request answers an expect call while another CS is in the room, that call should be put on hold and handed off to the other CS, leaving the CS free to handle the transport call. 3. Should another CS answer a call that is related to the transport, the caller should be put on hold until the CS handling the transport is available to take the call. 4. All calls should be made through the dedicated transport phone line (5-2710) to ensure free use of the phone line and proper recording. a. See 03.07 Dedicated Transport Communications Phone Line","1. Once the Communications Specialist (CS) receives a request for the CCTT, the Team is dispatched according to policy. a. See 04.04 Initiating a Transport Team Request Policy for details. 2. Complete a Ground Risk Assessment Tool (GRAT). If the score is between 10-20, dispatch the mission. If the score is above 20, notify the on-duty crew before dispatching the mission. Document the GRAT score and discussions in RescueNet notes. a. EXCEPTION: In the case of a referring physician that is unsure of their need for a critical care team transport, the CS can delay dispatching the CCTT until the Medical Control Physician and referring physician determine if the CCTT is appropriate. i. A delay in dispatching is also acceptable in certain circumstances where there is not an exact plan and/or additional planning is required (ex. flights, elective transfers, hospitals in close proximity) if the patient's condition allows . 3. RescueNet will send the following auto-page information once the call has been assigned to a vehicle: a. Referring hospital, unit, patient name, and nature of call. b. Communication Specialists must input DOB, weight, airway status, gestational age (<1 year), and any special instructions. c. Special instructions are input into the comments section and can include, but are not limited to: i. Special equipment, instructions, or requests ii. Location information 4. Document any delays in dispatching calls or out of chute time under ""Team Delay"" in notes section in RescueNet. 5. Pending Calls a. In the event that the CCTT is on a call and a second request is received, triaged, and all parties are comfortable with the extended ETA, the following text page should be sent to the Crew Chief: i. ""Call Pending, Referring Hospital, Patient Age, Gender, Nature"" ii. This page should be sent via RescueNet paging, NOT by assigning the call to the truck while it is still assigned to the current trip. iii. The Crew Chief will confirm the receipt of the pending call and get further information once the first transport is completed. b. In the event that the CCTT is en-route to a call, but not already on scene, the Crew Chief, MCP and referring MD can be conferenced together to triage the second request. 6. Change of Shift a. The CS should always page the on-duty crew per these guidelines until the crew has been formally relieved by the oncoming shift. 7. Rapid Notification a. In the event that rapid notification is necessary or in cases when paging is not preferred, the CCTT can also be reached by phone. In cases of diverting to a higher priority call, the CCTT can also be contacted by radio when in a BCH ambulance. In all of these cases, the call should be entered into and assigned in RescueNet when appropriate. Always document all notifications. 8. Resolving Complex Transports a. If there is not a plan in place for any call involving the Critical Care Transport Team within 30 minutes of the call start, page nursing management (pager 2170)","1.

What is the hospital doing to support research education and training for all clinical staff and how can new nurses get involved in these opportunities,0,"1. Any dietitian, dietetic technician or administrative staff wishing to attend a continuing education program outside of the hospital will submit a written request to the Clinical Nutrition (CN) Director. The CN Manager/Supervisor will annually review continuing education records of staff to assess future education needs and make recommendations as necessary. 2. On-going education opportunities are offered to staff. Examples of such forums include weekly clinical nutrition patient care discussions, weekly GI-Nutrition conferences, Hospital Grand Rounds, Longwood Medical Area Nutrition Rounds, Journal Club and hospital training programs. Some sessions offer continuing professional education units and these sessions will have Training and Development Forms available for staff who attend.","Staffing plans are developed based on the American Nurses Association principles of Nurse Staffing, third edition (2020). These principles include the characteristics and considerations of the healthcare consumer, the registered nurses, and other interprofessional team members and staff. Other influencing factors include the organizational approach to the delivery of nursing care services and the practice environment on the delivery of care (ANA, 2020). Therapies, services, and activities related to patient care reflect the needs of the patient and their families with consideration for any physical and psychosocial limitations. The staffing plan considers the number of patients and the resources required to deliver the needed level of care to all patients. The principle needs of the patient population influence and determine the competencies required for safe nursing practice on an ongoing basis. Unit and hospital based leadership provide added structure and guidance in the development of competencies which are evaluated on a regular basis. Additionally, the hospital maintains policies, which are also reviewed on a routine basis, that support the needs and safety of patients and nursing staff. The nurse staffing for the Inpatient Cardiology unit includes registered nurses and clinical assistants. Registered nurses range in experience from new graduate nurses to more than 30 years of clinical practice. Attention is given to keeping 80% of the nursing staff with at least 2 years of clinical experience. The nurses on the Inpatient Cardiology unit work 12-hour shifts to provide continuity and optimal support of patient flow on the unit. Daily staffing plans are adapted to accommodate the current census and number of higher acuity patients; a combination of 1:2 and 1:3 assignments are constructed to provide the appropriate nursing hours to more complex patients. Staffing plans and patient assignments are informed by an evidenced based acuity and nursing workload tool. Staff nurses self-schedule their hours. The shifts are then balanced by the ""time scheduler"", a designated staff nurse, to ensure there is an appropriate composition of total staff numbers, skill mix, and experience. Each shift has a dedicated charge nurse who provides oversight to the daily flow and operations of our unit including real time staffing needs and clinical support. Additionally, clinical support is provided by the 1-3 resource nurses who are scheduled for each shift based on availability and need. All staff are well versed in utilizing the chain of command when additional clinical or leadership support is required. Ongoing evaluation of the staffing plan is driven by trends identified via nurse-sensitive indicators, which help to evaluate its effectiveness. Furthermore, ""staffing plans must be conducive to adjustment to reflect changes in evidence and outcomes, care scenarios, and the needs of the population served, all of which can vary from hour to hour, day to day, and shift to shift (ANA, 2020 p. 16)."" All staff are encouraged to pursue advancement through the clinical advancement ladder. On average, 25-30% of the unit's staff nurses are promoted to either Staff Nurse II or III. Also known as the ""Leadership group,"" these members act as clinical leaders by participating in the development, implementation, and evaluation of unit goals. More formal leadership, education, and clinical supervision is provided by a core team of nurse educators, nurse practice specialists, a clinical research coordinator, and clinical coordinators. Unit level leaders report to a Nurse Director and the Vice President for Cardiovascular and Critical Care Programs. Residents and fellows or nurse practitioners manage the cardiac medical patients. Nurse practitioners manage the cardiac surgical patients. All provider structures are under the direction of either an attending cardiac surgeon or attending cardiologist. Case Managers are responsible for supporting discharge planning and utilization review processes. Hospital supports such as administrative staff, phone devices, transport services, housekeeping, food services, phlebotomy and laboratory services, and hospital workstations reduce the amount of time spent away from patient care.","The American Nurses Association's (ANA, 2020) Principles for Nurse Staffing and the Massachusetts ICU Nurse Staffing Law provides a foundation which influence unit-staffing patterns to ensure safe and comprehensive patient care. These principles include the characteristics and considerations of the healthcare consumer, the registered nurses, and other inter-professional team members and staff. The staffing plan considers the unit census, patients' level of acuity, and the resources required to deliver the necessary level of care to each patient. Other influencing factors include the organizational approach to the delivery of nursing care services and the practice environment on the delivery of care (ANA, 2020). Therapies, services, and activities related to patient care reflect the needs of the patient and their families with consideration for any physical and psychosocial limitations.

The nurse staffing for the NICU includes registered nurses and clinical assistants. Registered nurses range in experience from new graduate nurses to nurses with more than 30 years of clinical practice. The nurses in the NICU work 12-hour shifts to provide continuity and optimal support of patient flow on the unit. Daily staffing plans are adjusted to accommodate patient census and acuity; the nurse to patient ratio in the NICU is 1:1 or 1:2, and at times, 2:1. There is a charge nurse on each shift, who does not have a patient assignment, to provide clinical support and unit operational oversight. Clinical resource nurses, 2 Nurse Practice Specialists and 1 nurse educator also provide resourcing and education. Staffing plans and nursing schedules are developed ensuring the appropriate staffing and skill mix. The NICU offers self-scheduling for nurses using foundational guidelines to ensure balanced staffing. The nursing director and clinical coordinator work closely on a day-to-day, shift-to-shift basis in partnership with the charge nurse to ensure that patient assignments are made by matching patient needs with nurse competencies. All staff are well versed in utilizing the chain of command when additional clinical or leadership support is required. Charge nurses utilize an evidenced based acuity and nursing workload tool to construct patient assignments. NICU charge nurses also use clinical judgment and clinical expertise to adjust staffing to respond to unanticipated staffing needs, patient status/acuity changes, and fluctuations in census. Ongoing evaluation of the staffing plan is driven by trends identified via nurse-sensitive indicators, which help to evaluate its effectiveness. Furthermore, ""staffing plans must be conducive to adjustment to reflect changes in evidence and outcomes, care scenarios, and the needs of the population served, all of which can vary from hour to hour, day to day, and shift to shift (ANA, 2020 p. 16)."" Staff in the NICU are engaged and have shared participation in decision-making around staffing as well as other operational activities. Professional development opportunities are essential to foster knowledge and support highly skilled staff. Promoting a culture of certification, offering continuing education and skill acquisition courses as well as fostering professional development programs all contribute to professional growth and advancement opportunities. The nursing clinical ladder program has designations of staff nurse and APN I, II, and III is one example of that support clinical performance and accomplishments. The NICU Medical Director, NICU Nursing Director and Associate Chief Nursing Officer (ACNO) of Cardiovascular/Critical Care Services are jointly accountable for unit operations and work collaboratively and transparently with staff. The attending physicians, fellows, nurse practitioners, nursing director, clinical coordinator, clinical nurse specialists, clinical educator, charge nurses, clinical resource nurses, in collaboration with the bedside nurses, are responsible for the day to day function of the NICU. Support teams and services that help enhance nursing care include patient experience staff, wireless phone devices, transport services, environmental services, food services, laboratory services, and other essential ancillary staff reduce the amount of time spent away from patient care.","The unit and unit staff of the Experimental Therapeutics Unit (ETU) are dedicated to the support of pediatric clinical research. The unit staff and environment provide an optimal setting for operationalizing research studies that help ensure the timely translation of scientific knowledge into effective patient care. The ETU offers support to investigators throughout the clinical research process: preparing for study start up, creating electronic physician order sets, providing access to ambulatory and inpatient space for study visits, administrative support, data collection, and lab processing in the unit core laboratory. Investigators have access to unit professional staff to aid in the excellent execution of study visits such as research nurses, research dieticians, and Investigational Drug Service pharmacists. ETU nurses and staff are CITI trained and have completed competency-based clinical research training and education in order to optimally support pediatric study subjects, families, investigators and study staff through the clinical research process.

Scroll down to ""CHB Staff."" The PI is always an authorized prescriber. If an individual is listed under ""CHB Staff"" and has prescribing rights at BCH, then they are considered an authorized prescriber.","1. Before an interventional trial can be conducted at BCH, the protocol must be submitted to the IRB and fully approved. 2. Approved protocols are listed in CHeRP. 3. Depending upon the study design, authorized prescribers participating in trials conducted in an approved location (see table above) may be listed in the protocol a variety of ways: I. By individual name as a specific authorized prescriber within the protocol itself and in CHeRP. These studies are NOT allowed to use the group process described below (II). a. Studies that have an IND and are expected to undergo an FDA audit: These can include studies involving an unapproved medication or an off-label use of an approved indication. b. The PI is responsible for adding the names of the authorized prescribers to CHeRP and ensuring that they have completed the necessary protocol training. i. Individuals whose name is not listed cannot prescribe the medication that is part of the study c. If the IP involved is managed by the pharmacy or Investigational Drug Service, the pharmacist must confirm that the prescriber has been authorized to prescribe the IP and that informed consent has been obtained prior to dispensing per the protocol. II. By group within the protocol itself (e.g., “all licensed clinicians authorized to prescribe medications within the ED”) a. The study medication is FDA approved and may be used either per its approved indication or off-label per the protocol b. The individual names are not listed in CHeRP or in the protocol c. The PI is responsible for ensuring that any prescribing the medication that is part of the protocol have completed the necessary protocol training. d. Pharmacy is able to dispense the IP upon the receipt of an order per the protocol but does not confirm the prescriber’s status as being an authorized prescriber.","As part of the protocol development process, the PI/Research Team should clearly specify how subjects will be assigned and which IP they will receive in the study methods section of the protocol. The PI and designated study personnel are responsible for following the randomization and blinding procedures described in the clinical trial protocol. Blinding is defined as a procedure in which one or more parties involved in the trial are kept unaware of the treatment assignment(s). Single-blinding usually refers to the subject(s) being unaware, and double blinding usually refers to the subject(s), investigator(s), monitor, and, in some cases, data analyst(s) being unaware of the treatment assignment(s). Randomization is defined as the process of assigning trial subjects to treatment or “placebo”/control groups by chance to determine the assignments in order to reduce bias. Un-blinding is defined as the process of identifying the treatment code of a subject or grouped results in studies where the treatment assignment is unknown to the subject, study team, and investigators. It is also referred to as “breaking the blind.” Any investigational protocol which requires randomization may have the randomization list provided by the sponsor or generated by an un-blinded biostatistician in the Clinical Research Program or other appropriate source. 1. PI and research personnel will receive and review the randomization procedure and manual, if applicable, prior to participant recruitment. 2. The PI and designated research personnel are responsible for ensuring that the randomization schedule is followed. 3. Blinding: a. The PI and research team will review the protocol to identify any study staff in the trial who should not be blinded to treatment b. Research personnel will verify that the sponsor has taken adequate steps to ensure that the treatments are indistinguishable. (e.g. masking syringes for placebo studies, over encapsulation) c. The master randomization codes should be maintained by IDS staff and/or the trial data manager with appropriate security measures and access control. 4. Un-blinding: a. Circumstances for un-blinding must be clearly established before the first patient begins treatment. Randomization procedures, if any, must be followed to ensure the code is broken only in accordance with the protocol. b. During study initiation, 24-hour sponsor contact information should be obtained including names, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses of the medical officer, monitor, and other relevant safety personnel. This information should be retained in a readily accessible location, known to all study staff. c. The study codes may be stored at the study site or may only be available directly from the sponsor. d. If stored at the study site, the code must be stored in a secure area with access by authorized personnel only. e. If un-blinding a participant is allowed during conduct of a clinical trial, the protocol must state procedures for obtaining permission to break the blind. f. In general, the code should only be broken in the case of an adverse event where it is necessary for the PI to know which treatment the patient is receiving before the participant can be treated. The code may also have to be broken if someone not in the study uses the investigational agent. ▪ For example, someone other than the subject in the participant’s household takes a study medication, the blind may be broken to determine treatment to be received g. When it is necessary to break the blind, the researcher must notify the IRB. h. In accordance to the protocol, the sponsor should be notified as soon as possible regarding the necessity of breaking the code. i. Accidental un-blinding must be reported to the IRB and sponsor as soon as it is known. j. Justification for premature/ accidental un-blinding of the investigational product should be documented (e.g. accidental un-blinding, un-blinding due to serious adverse event) in the study binder.","1.

What is the meaning of PPE when it comes to sterile compounding,0,"• Don the required personal protect equipment (PPE) and garb per SOP. Hazardous Medication: PPE For Sterile Compounding - SOP • Note: the second pair of ASTM 6978-rated outer glove must be sterile. • Outer sterile gloves must be changed at least every 30 minutes or when grossly contaminated. • Gown must be changed every 3 hours or less or if contaminated. • Prepare the PEC based on cleaning protocol. Sterile Compounding Area Cleaning & Disinfecting: Primary Engineering Control (PEC) Interior Surfaces & equipment in the PEC - SOP 1. Once the PEC is prepared, place a disposable absorbent plastic backed mat on the compounding work surface. 2. Remove packaging (if container not already removed and wiped) and wipe each item to be used to remove residue, then wipe with IPA prior to placing in BSC. 3. Assemble all materials used for compounding. 4. CSTD must be used when compounding sterile preparation of antineoplastic hazardous products. ◦ Vials that cannot use the CSTD will be handled in such a manner so as to always maintain a negative pressure within the vial. (e.g. due to coring, or route of administration) ◦ CSTDs are not attached to final products that route does not allow closed system administration (e.g. Intrathecal, intralesional, intramuscular/ subcutaneous) 5. Disposable absorbent plastic backed mats are used on the work surfaces of C-PECs. ◦ The mat must be changed each shift (e.g. batch) or whenever it is overtly contaminated. 6. The mat is discarded at the end of the compounding activity into the hazardous waste container. Compounding • Syringes and IV sets with Luer-Lock fittings should be used whenever possible • Use appropriate DEHP or non-DEHP bag and IV set for the medication as defined by the manufacturer as noted on the preparation chart or manufacturing log. • Syringes should be large enough to contain medication no more than 80% of capacity when dispensing the total drug dose.Vials containing hazardous drugs must not be vented externally into the C-PEC but must always incorporate the use of a Closed System Transfer Device or maintain negative pressure. • Manipulating glass ampules of drugs represent one of the most dangerous compounding techniques due to the physical drug being exposed to the environment and can result in a spill. ◦ Contents of an ampule should be gently tapped before opening to ensure that no liquid remains in the tip of the ampule. ◦ Sterile alcohol (70%) swab will be wrapped around the neck of the ampule while opening. ◦ Glass tip and alcohol swab are discarded in the designated container. ◦ Filter needle is used to withdraw the correct amount of drug from the broken ampule. • Arrange products so that a clear, uninterrupted path of HEPA-filtered air will bathe all critical sites at all times during the planned procedures. Note: BSC • Items should be localized on the work surface in “clean” and “dirty” groups. • Do not compound a different hazardous product at the same time within the same workspace of the PEC. • All rubber stoppers of vials are cleaned with sterile isopropyl alcohol before the introduction of a CSTD, or needle or spike per Disinfecting Critical Sites and Introducing Items into the Primary Engineering Controls (PEC) - SOP • Using aseptic technique, prepare sterile preparation as outlined by the manufacturer and the final dosage needed. • After preparation of every admixture, the contents of the container are thoroughly mixed and inspected for the presence of particulate matter, evidence of incompatibility, or other defects. • Trace contaminated preparation materials (i.e., gauze, capped used syringes, adsorbent mats, empty vials, gloves) must be disposed of in trace hazardous drug waste containers for proper wasting according to policy. • Remove all bulk contaminated materials (e.g., partially filled vials and returned drug greater than 3% of original volume) in a sealed plastic hazardous bag and dispose of in the appropriate labelled disposable hazardous waste container per Hazardous Drug: Disposal and Hazardous Medication/ Hazardous Waste Disposal poster • Wipe down the final product to remove any trace residue prior to placing into the final delivery container (Sealed hazardous bag) • Following completion of compounding and removal of contaminated materials, clean and wipe down the interior of the C-PEC Per SOP (link) • Place chemotherapy (anti-neoplastic hazardous) in appropriate container for delivery to the nursing med- room. • Doffing of outer hazardous PPE must be performed prior to exiting HD sterile compounding room per Hazardous Medication: PPE for Sterile Compounding: includes outer gloves, outer booties, bouffant, mask, HD gown and beard cover (if used). • Prior to entering non-HD sterile compounding room, HD PPE is doffed (as above). New PPE for non-HD production is donned prior to entering non-HD sterile compounding room per PPE for Sterile Compounding NOTE: The pneumatic tube system should never be used for delivery of hazardous drugs.","All nonsterile compounded liquids are prepared by following the Master Formulation Record. 1. Create a formulation worksheet, formulation log and labels using the compounding software program. (e.g. Compound Assist®) 2. Visually inspect all ingredients for correct identity, strength and quality before use. Ensure no ingredients used are expired. 3. Wash hands [Hand Hygiene SOP] and don appropriate PPE [Nonsterile Compounding Area Entry, Preparation for Compounding] 4. All compounding is performed in the appropriate powder containment hood 5. Weigh, measure or count the calculated amount of each ingredient needed indicated on the Master Formulation Record. 6. Crush tablet(s) or content of capsule(s) using a mortar and pestle. The type of mortar and pestle is determined by the Master Formulation Record based on the ingredients (e.g. use glass for APIs that stain or are hazardous). Sieves are used if indicated on the Master Formulation Record in order to reduce particle size or sift out tablet coating. 7. Use the following techniques when compounding a suspension: a. Wet the powders by adding a small amount of wetting agent to the powders in a mortar and triturating so that a thick uniform paste is obtained. b. Add a small amount of suspending vehicle to the paste and mix until smooth c. Transfer to a graduated cylinder. Rinse the mortar with additional suspending vehicle. 8. QS, if indicated on the Master Formulation Record, to final volume and shake until dissolved 9. Transfer to appropriate container (e.g. amber, glass). 10. Affix compounded product label and add auxiliary labels 11. The compounding pharmacist will perform the following quality control procedures: a. Measure and record the pH of the compound to ensure it is within acceptable pH range as described by the Master Formulation Record b. Verify the final volume c. Visually inspect the suspension to ensure it meets the expected color, clarity and homogeneity. d. Pharmacist signs the Master Formulation Log and initials the label of the product.","• Areas where HDs are handled and all reusable equipment and devices must be deactivated, decontaminated, and cleaned. • Sterile compounding areas and devices must be subsequently disinfected. • Cleaning of nonsterile compounding areas must comply with 〈 USP 795 〉 and cleaning of sterile compounding areas must comply with 〈 USP 797 〉 . • Personnel who perform deactivation, decontamination, cleaning, and disinfection activities in HD handling areas must be trained in appropriate procedures to protect themselves and the environment from contamination • Personnel performing this procedure must wear appropriate PPE resistant to the cleaning agents used, including two pairs of chemotherapy gloves and impermeable disposable gowns. • Agents used for deactivation, decontamination, and cleaning must be applied through the use of wipes wet with appropriate solution and not delivered by a spray bottle to avoid spreading HD residue.","1. Doff outer gloves and gown prior to exiting the buffer room 2. Use the non-contaminated inner gloves to doff all PPE (except 1 st set of shoe covers) 3. Doff second pair of shoe covers while stepping over the line of demarcation into the anteroom from the buffer room 4. Doff surgical mask 5. Doff beard cover, if appropriate 6. Doff coverall in anteroom if entering the dirty side of the anteroom. Keep coverall donned to enter non-HD sterile room. 7. Doff inner gloves last 8. Wash hands with soap and water 9. Dry with low lint towel NOTE: if moving to a non-HD sterile compounding room new gloves, bouffant, mask, and beard cover (if applicable) must donned to prevent tracking hazardous drugs to the non-HD room per PPE for Sterile Compounding.","Once the proper PPE for each process/equipment has been selected, employees must be trained on the PPE. At a minimum, each employee using PPE must know: • The nature and extent of hazard(s) present for each process the employee operates • When PPE should be worn • What PPE is necessary • Use and limitations of the PPE • How to properly inspect, don, doff, adjust and wear the PPE • How to determine if PPE is no longer effective or is damaged • How to get replacement PPE • How to properly care for, maintain, store, and dispose of the PPE Retraining of employees is required whenever: • Changes in the workplace render the previous training obsolete • Changes in the type of PPE render previous training obsolete • Employer observed inadequacies in an employees' knowledge or use of assigned PPE indicates that an employee has not retained the necessary understanding or skill",3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
What special considerations should be taken for trach and trachventdependent patients perioperatively,1,"• During care coordination: ◦ Vent-dependent patients should be considered for SDWU unless they will already be onsite for pre- op testing, subspecialty visits, and/or labs ◦ Document the following information in the Respiratory ROS section of the PAEF: ▪ Trach details (type, size, +/- cuff) ▪ Suction (frequency, catheter size) ▪ Vent (type, settings) ▪ Oxygen requirement (continuous, nocturnal) ◦ If applicable, notify CAPE team of upcoming pre-op visit, surgery, and admission ◦ Note trach/vent status in PAEF Special Needs List ◦ Email the Perioperative Care Coordination Clinic (PCCC) charge nurse with the patient's name, MRN, trach/vent status, date of pre-op visit, date of surgery, and facility status; trach and trach/vent patients require contact precautions because suctioning is considered an aerosol-generating procedure (AGP) ◦ Additional information about trach/vent patients: ▪ RT will not assess patient or provide supplies unless there are active issues or concerns in Pre- Op Holding (POH) ▪ Non-facility, vent-dependent patients remain on home vent in POH but will switch to a hospital vent if waiting > 2 hrs ▪ Facility, vent-dependent patients are switched to a hospital vent upon arrival in POH ▪ All patients will use a hospital vent intraoperatively ▪ Non-ICU patients will use their home vent in the PACU; ICU patients will remain on a hospital vent while in the ICU ◦ Day Surgery (DSU) considerations: ▪ On Day of Surgery (DOS), patient to bring: ▪ ""Go Bag,"" including backup trachs the same size and one size smaller than the existing trach ▪ Home vent for use in POH and PACU (if needed) • During pre-op visit (EXT/SDA patients): ◦ To conserve resources, connect home vent/devices to wall supply 2 ◦ Parent/guardian is responsible for respiratory care during pre-op visit ◦ On DOS, patient to bring: ▪ ""Go Bag,"" including backup trachs the same size and one size smaller than the existing trach ▪ Home vent for use in POH (if 24 hr vent dependent) ◦ For facility patients, notify care team (surgeon, POH dl, case management dl, COPP, and PCCC charge nurses) of plan for DOS ◦ Page RT for trach or trach/vent issues or concerns",Trach and trach/vent-dependent patients require special considerations perioperatively. Please note the following: • A patient who relies on ventilator support for any part of the day or night should bring the home ventilator to the hospital on the day of surgery. • Respiratory Therapy (RT) can be reached at pager #7377 for any trach or trach/vent issues or concerns.,"1. Please see Boston Children's Hospital formulary and Lexi-comp for dosing: a. Boston Children's Hospital Formulary: Poractant alfa (Curosurf) 2. Surfactant replacement is indicated in patients with surfactant deficiency associated with respiratory distress syndrome. 3. Surfactant replacement has also been used in patients following cardiopulmonary bypass, and with meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). 4. There are no known contraindications to surfactant replacement therapy. However, special consideration should be taken in discussion with the medical team for neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage, and pre-existing pneumothoraces. 5. Patients with severe respiratory failure (e.g. ECMO referrals who require HFOV with high mean airway pressures and INO), may not tolerate the instillation procedure and may have further cardio-respiratory instability. 6. Acute changes in lung compliance may result in acute changes in oxygenation and ventilation from pneumothorax or pulmonary hemorrhage.","• Provide hospital-based Family Education Sheets to facilitate teaching caregivers the following skills: (education sheets available on Tracheostomy Website) (* indicates discipline responsible for providing and documenting education) ◦ Tracheostomy Site Care and Tie Change (*nursing) ◦ Suctioning a Tracheostomy Tube (*nursing) ◦ Use of Self-inflating Manual Resuscitation Bag (*RT trach resource) ◦ Tracheostomy Tube Change (*RT trach resource) ◦ Humidification for a Tracheostomy (RT trach resource) ◦ Application of a Speaking Valve or Cap (if applicable) (*RT trach resource) • Assign tracheostomy education videos on GetWellNetwork for family review.

What are the responsibilities of the Primary Provider when signing the consent form for a planned procedure intervention or treatment,0,"The following provides an overview of the informed consent process within BCH: 1. The Primary Provider, or a provider within the same department (e.g., attending physician, fellow, resident, APRN, PA), will have an oral discussion with the parent/guardian and/or the patient that includes an overview of the anticipated benefits and potential risks as well as available alternatives; 2. The oral discussion is documented by completing the written informed consent form, which includes a summary of the oral discussion as well as a listing of the other providers actively participating in the patient's case (including but not limited to Physicians, Advance Practice Registered Nurses, Physician Assistants, Fellows, and Residents). a. If it is not known if other providers will be present, leave field blank. After a procedure is completed, a list of providers who are participating will be pulled from the medical record and made available to the patient (parent/guardian) in the patient portal. The portal list will capture any changes in providers (planned or unanticipated) who join after a procedure, treatment, or intervention has started. 3. The written informed consent form should be signed by a parent/guardian (for a child under 18). For patients over 18, they should sign if they have the capacity to understand the consent process. ◦ Please contact the BCH Attorney on Call with questions about capacity. 4. Please note that there are two signatures lines for the provider: ◦ The provider obtaining consent signature is for those providers within the same department (e.g., attending physician, fellow, resident, APRN, PA) who reviewed the form with the patient prior to a procedure, treatment, or intervention. The purpose of this signature is to assist with those circumstances where the primary provider may be unable to obtain the consent in advance. ◦ The primary provider signature is required prior to the start of any procedure, treatment, or intervention. i. Please note, the primary provider performing the service may be the only provider who discusses the case with the patient (parent/guardian) and therefore only the primary provider signature is completed – both signature lines are not necessary to begin a service. ii. The goal is that the Primary Provider should sign the form after having met with the parent/ guardian and/or the patient. However, if circumstances (emergency, parents/family not available, DCF custody) arise where the primary provider is not be able to meet with family prior, the primary provider should still sign based on the parent (guardian) and/or patient signing the form in advance with a provider obtaining consent. iii. The Primary Provider is an attending, fellow, resident, or advance practice clinician with approved privileges from the department to perform the service(s). 5. The signed written informed consent should be submitted to HIM to be scanned into the patient's medical record. Note: if the form is not signed because of a medical emergency or refusal to consent, document the nature of the medical emergency or circumstances of the refusal in the patient's medical record.","1. The Primary Provider performing the recommended procedure, intervention, or treatment has an oral discussion and obtains a written informed consent document signed by the Primary Provider and the patient (and/or the parent/legal representative). 2. The consent process provides the parent/guardian and/or the patient with an opportunity to make an informed and voluntary decision on whether or not to undergo a recommended procedure, intervention, or treatment. 3.

Please note that the patient and/or the parent/ guardian should be aware of who will be the primary provider prior to the start of their procedure, intervention, or treatment.","• For inpatient services, consent is valid for the duration of the hospital stay, both during and following the procedure, intervention, or treatment. If there is a significant change in the patient's condition that would reasonably be expected to alter the treatment plan or require additional procedures (that was not identified or discussed with the patient as part of the initial consent), a new consent may need to be obtained for the subsequent treatment. • For outpatient services, the consent remains in effect throughout the course of continuing services, provided the patient is continuing the same or similar recommended procedure, intervention, or treatment for the same initial diagnosis. There is a general standard that a consent should be reviewed and updated on an annual basis to determine if the course of treatment or evaluation being provided has changed since the initial consent was signed. • When the treatment plan involves recurrent treatments and procedures, a consent is not required for each repetitive treatment/procedure, unless there is a significant deviation from the original plan, the patient's condition or diagnosis changes from the initial intent of the consent (which was not something identified or discussed with the patient and/or the parent/guardian as part of the initial consent form), or different treatments are being provided during the recurring treatment plan. • There is no specified or standard time period in which a consent should be obtained prior to a procedure.

What are the potential negative outcomes associated with excess free iron in bank blood and how can ultrafiltration be used to correct this issue before transfusion,1,"• Bank blood is known to have nonphysiologic values for many electrolytes which can lead to an undesirable effect on hemodynamics once transfused (1-4). Cell saver washing of PRBC units has been shown to effectively control mediators of hemodynamic change seen with stored blood (2,5). Though, increased cell wall fragility and hemolysis after processing and during bypass may be seen (5,6). This can lead to excess free iron in the blood which has been associated with negative outcomes (7-12). Ultrafiltration of blood prior to transfusion can be used to correct known issues with bank blood. • The method below provides the perfusionist one option for correcting issues with bank blood before transfusion to the pump circuit (13-15). This is done using the blood bag as the reservoir, a blood spike pin, an additional stopcock, and the cell saver circuit blood line. In short, after transferring heparinized plasmalyte to the blood bag, the filtered blood from the bag is directed to the MUF circuit by way of a line from the stopcock of the quick prime line and returned to the blood bag by way of the (MUF) return line to a dispensing pin in the other port of the blood bag.","Bank blood is known to have nonphysiologic values for many electrolytes which can lead to an undesirable effect on hemodynamics once transfused (1-4).

Though, increased cell wall fragility and hemolysis after processing and during bypass may be seen (5,6). This can lead to excess free iron in the blood which has been associated with negative outcomes (7-12). Prebypass ultrafiltration can be used to correct known issues with bank blood for patients requiring a blood prime in the bypass circuit (13-16). Standard 13.2 in the 2019 AmSECT Pediatric and Congenital Standards and Guidelines states that, ""When priming with exogenous blood, a circuit prime gas and electrolyte levels shall be obtained prior to initiation of bypass and adjustments made to correct any physiologic abnormalities"" is a standard which shall be perfomred (17). Additionally, guidelines 13.1 and 13.2 state that. ""When priming with exogenous blood, the use of prebypass ultrafiltration (preBUF) or washed red blood cells should be used during priming procedure"" and ""the perfusionist should consider matching prime composition to the individual patient values"" (17). These two guidelines should be given strong consideration. The PBUF policy aims to meet the standard and if indicated, the guidelines as well.","• The use of blood products in the extracorporeal circuit is dictated by patient need, physician consultation and policy guidelines. • The use of other blood products, such as plasma and platelets (rarely) in the bypass circuit is dictated by the attending surgeon and/or anesthesiologist. • Refer to guidelines Bypass Prime Selection (2.6), Priming the Perfusion Circuit (2.7) and Cell Saver Washing of Blood for Bypass Primes (2.14) for additional information. • Conventional and zero balance ultrafiltration must be considered when administering bank blood and to control the electrolytes and lactate level in the patient's circulating blood volume. • All blood products are irradiated (PRBCs are also leukoreduced) before they are sent to the CVOR. This is an important consideration in the prevention of graft versus host disease and significant morbidity or even mortality. While this practice leads to potassium leak from the cells, it is generally considered acceptable to do this up to 18 hours in advance. Our Blood Bank practice typically has irradiation done <6 hours before dispense and so the potassium increase should be minimal (1). • There is a laminated Suspected Transfusion Reaction guidance document hanging on every anesthesia machine. The Blood Bank must be notified (5-6260 or 5-4166, or pager 6260) if a transfusion reaction is suspected so that a Blood Bank physician can advise on next steps. • Refer to PolicyStat document, Transfusion of Blood or Blood Components, for information regarding product verification and transfusion practice. • Recommendations for minimum acceptable hematocrit levels for different patient populations are listed in the chart below.","1. Confirm that the patient has an active extended consent for transfusion of blood products. 2. Check to see if patient requires pre-medication.

Prepare blood and perform transfusion as specified in the patient care manual Transfusion of Blood Products. 5. Blood should enter the dialysis circuit pre-dialyzer. Throughout course of transfusion, dialysate flow must be on. 6. Volume of blood to be infused is given over a time period that allows ultrafiltration of an equivalent volume. a. Transfusion(s) may be administered rapidly during dialysis due to fluid volume of the cells being removed at the same time as infusion. b. Volume of filtered cells is included in total ultrafiltration goal of the dialysis treatment. 7. Remain with patient for first 5 minutes of transfusion.

Why is it important to verify termination of a pregnancy before proceeding with a planned procedure for a patient who has recently terminated a pregnancy,1,"• Per BCH Anesthesia Clinical Guidelines & Policies: ◦ In general, patients who have recently had a termination of pregnancy within 6 weeks before surgery should not be scheduled for elective surgery. Reasons for this include a persistent elevation in ßHCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) levels for up to 4 weeks after a termination and for resolution of the maternal physiologic changes of pregnancy to the pre-pregnancy state. ◦ For all patients who have had a recent termination of a pregnancy (greater than 6 weeks and within 3 months of a scheduled surgical procedure), a written note (for a surgical termination) must be obtained from the clinician who performed the termination. This note should document any complications (infection, bleeding) from the termination and verify that the termination was complete. ◦ In addition, for patients who have had a medical termination of pregnancy with mifepristone/ misoprostol, the clinician responsible for the termination must document that the termination was complete with either with a follow up ultrasound or ßHCG level. ◦ All female patients (12 years of age and older or any patient who has started menstruation) must have a ßHCG (either urine or serum) obtained before undergoing a surgical procedure. • Additional Considerations: ◦ It is considered ""best care"" for a patient to follow up with the Gynecologist who performed the termination to verify termination ◦ If a patient cannot follow up with their clinician prior to surgery, a ßHCG level can be used to verify termination ▪ If ßHCG >5 mIU/mL (i.e. positive), the case will need to be cancelled and the patient will need an evaluation by the Gynecologist who performed the termination ◦ Regardless of the method of termination (surgical vs. medical), ßHCG levels are an acceptable way to verify pregnancy termination","If a patient has recently terminated a pregnancy, it is important to verify termination prior to moving forward with a planned procedure.","• A competent adult or a mature minor who has been married may consent to a termination of pregnancy. Other minors who wish a termination of pregnancy must give consent but the consent of both parents is also required, unless such minor is unable or unwilling to obtain parental consent. Under such circumstance the minor may obtain a court order. Any minors requesting a termination of pregnancy should be referred to the Adolescent Gynecology Clinic (355-7648) where the appropriate consent or court order can be obtained.","1. Inform all post-menarcheal and age 12 and older patients born with a uterus and parents/guardians of minors who meet these criteria that a pregnancy test will be performed before the initial treatment or planned surgery that could be potentially harmful to a fetus. 2. Assure that all post-menarcheal and age 12 and older patients born with a uterus and parents/guardians of minors, who meet these criteria, have been informed about the following: a. BCH's policy regarding pregnancy testing b. Provided written information prohibiting disclosure of positive pregnancy test results to individuals other than the patient. 3. Include urine or serum HCG as part of the pre-surgical or pre-treatment work-up to rule out the presence of pregnancy in all post-menarcheal or age 12 and older patients born with a uterus. a. First morning void urines are the preferred urine sample. b. If the patient cannot void spontaneously serum/plasma HCG is required. c. Serum HCG is the recommended test to rule out pregnancy due to its diagnostic sensitivity compared to urine. 4. The accountability and responsibility to override the HCG testing is at the discretion of the prescriber, e.g., emergency situations. Therapy that could be potentially harmful to a fetus includes but is not limited to: a. Anesthesia b. Surgery c. Chemotherapy d. Certain prescribed pharmaceutical agents refer to the BCH Online Formulary e. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) f. Radiation Therapy g. Diagnostic and Interventional X-ray Procedures h. Medical Uses of Radioactive isotopes Note: Specific radiologic procedures requiring pregnancy testing are defined in departmental policies 5. HCG testing requires a prescriber order. 6. Patients who arrive from an outside facility and have a negative pregnancy test within 48 hours of surgery/procedure do not need a repeat HCG. 7. Collect urine for HCG at the time of the visit. 8. When Pregnancy Test is Positive: a. Obtain confirmation of positive pregnancy test results by repeat serum testing whenever questionable. b. Counsel patient about their options of disclosure to their parents or guardian. c. Consider the impact of pregnancy on the proposed surgery, anesthesia, or other therapies and determine whether the planned procedure needs to be canceled.","Safety considerations for potentially pregnant research MRI participants should be based on conditions of either possibility, pregnant, or not pregnant. For imaging in which there is no known increase in risk with pregnancy, it is not necessary to determine if the potentially pregnant participant is actually pregnant or not. Current data and a number of research studies, reviewed recently by Tocchio et al., 2015, have failed to demonstrate any reproducible harmful effects on pregnant females at magnetic field strengths of 3T or less. Although there are no harmful effects, a woman who is pregnant, who may be pregnant, or who is trying to become pregnant, may have an elevated risk of anxiety towards the MRI exam. Given the high rate of spontaneous miscarriage in the first trimester, there is the possibility that a spontaneous miscarriage could be mistakenly blamed on procedures associated with undergoing an MRI exam. If the risk of the MRI procedure to a pregnant woman is assessed as low, then a verbal response of ""no'' to a pregnancy question is sufficient to allow the participation in a research MRI. If the response to a pregnancy question is ""unsure'' or ""possibly'' then an HCG pregnancy test should be done, and if negative, the subject may undergo the research MRI exam. It is possible for a pregnancy test to be a false negative, especially very early in pregnancy. If the pregnancy test is positive, a re-assessment of the subjects understanding of the potential risks and benefits of the research MRI procedure should be made and informed consent to participate obtained again, in light of the new information Current clinical MRI safety guidelines should be followed in order to establish the risk profile that a research MRI protocol would pose to a pregnant woman. This risk assessment should be based on the safety considerations for fetal MRI exams. Imaging of the subject's brain and other body parts may have reduced risk for pregnant participants in comparison to direct imaging of the fetus in pregnant participants. If the risk of the MRI procedure to a pregnant woman is not assessed as low, then the usual considerations for a more than minimal risk research imaging procedure would need to be made. The ACR-SPR 2015 practice guidelines for fetal MRI state that, ""...present data have not conclusively documented any deleterious effects of MR imaging exposure of the developing fetus. Therefore no special consideration is recommended for the first, versus any other, trimester in pregnancy."" While the available data supports the safety of MRI use in both fetal and neonatal imaging at 1.5 and 3 Tesla, there are safety parameters which should be considered when performing MRI exams, including (1) static magnetic field exposure, (2) specific absorption rate (SAR), (3) gradient field switching, and (4) sound pressure levels (SPL). Furthermore, consideration to the safety of imaging in pregnancy with sedation, anesthesia or contrast agents, such as gadolinium compounds, must be reviewed since ""the risk to the fetus with administration of gadolinium-based MRI contrast agents remains unknown and may be harmful"" (ACR-SPR 2015).",2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

Even if another provider or team takes over the case at some point in the procedure, the full list of providers participating in the case will be pulled and send to the patient portal after the procedure is completed. Note: if there are two or more primary providers performing services during the same procedure, the following will apply: ▪ If the individual skills of two or more providers in the same specialty are required to perform a specific procedure on the same patient during the same operative session, then there should only be one consent form. The provider performing the majority of the procedure is listed as the Primary Provider and the additional providers who are actively participating listed as ""Other Providers"" on the consent form for documentation purposes only. Each provider who is actively participating in the procedure may need to document separate operative notes which are used to submit claims for their respective services provided (with the appropriate modifier code). ▪ If two or more providers from different specialties are required to jointly perform a specific procedure on the same patient during the same operative session, the same rules outlined above should apply. For the purposes of the consent form only, there should only be one consent form with the provider performing the majority of the procedure is listed as the Primary Provider and the additional providers who are actively participating listed as ""Other Providers"" on the consent form for documentation purposes only. Each provider who is actively participating in the procedure may need to document separate operative notes which are used to submit claims for their respective services provided (with the appropriate modifier code). ▪ If there are two or more providers of different specialties each performing a different procedure on the same patient during the same operative session, the providers will each need to obtain their own consent (e.g., a surgeon and an anesthesiologist). ▪ If the Primary Provider listed on the form changes prior to a procedure, intervention, or treatment, consider either obtaining a new informed consent form, or crossing out and inserting the new primary provider name. Please note that the patient and/or the parent/ guardian should be aware of who will be the primary provider prior to the start of their procedure, intervention, or treatment.","• For inpatient services, consent is valid for the duration of the hospital stay, both during and following the procedure, intervention, or treatment. If there is a significant change in the patient's condition that would reasonably be expected to alter the treatment plan or require additional procedures (that was not identified or discussed with the patient as part of the initial consent), a new consent may need to be obtained for the subsequent treatment. • For outpatient services, the consent remains in effect throughout the course of continuing services, provided the patient is continuing the same or similar recommended procedure, intervention, or treatment for the same initial diagnosis. There is a general standard that a consent should be reviewed and updated on an annual basis to determine if the course of treatment or evaluation being provided has changed since the initial consent was signed. • When the treatment plan involves recurrent treatments and procedures, a consent is not required for each repetitive treatment/procedure, unless there is a significant deviation from the original plan, the patient's condition or diagnosis changes from the initial intent of the consent (which was not something identified or discussed with the patient and/or the parent/guardian as part of the initial consent form), or different treatments are being provided during the recurring treatment plan. • There is no specified or standard time period in which a consent should be obtained prior to a procedure. If the provider's practice is that the consent is normally obtained at a specified period prior to the planned procedure, intervention or treatment, (e.g., one week, one month, longer) the provider should maintain those practices.","Patient Description Waltham Boston Does the patient have co-morbidities that require Yes ** Yes** additional support in order to complete the prescribed treatment?

Non-violent/non-self-destructive behavior 1. Restraints for non-violent/non-self-destructive behavior may be temporarily released and then reapplied when an RN is present. Note: A temporary, directly supervised release by RNs that occurs for the purpose of caring for patient needs (e.g., toileting, feeding, or ROM exercises) is not considered discontinuation of the restraint or seclusion intervention. As long as the patient remains under direct RN supervision the restraint is not considered to be discontinued. Violent/self-destructive behavior or seclusion 1. Restraints placed for violent/self-destructive are used when: a. Alternatives to restraint and less restrictive measures are unsuccessful. b.

A Facedown position is not used unless clinically indicated.","The intent, not the device, determines whether or not the restriction is considered a restraint. Restraints are not part of routine care. An authorized BCH clinician should only consider the use of restraint for the immediate physical safety of the patient, staff, or others. • BCH clinician ◦ Registered RN, Advanced Practice RN, Physician Assistant, Physician • Medication Restraint ◦ A drug or medication when used as a restriction to manage the patient's behavior or restrict the patient's freedom of movement. This includes the involuntary administration of medication for the immediate management of violent or self-destructive behavior, regardless of the route of administration, to control the patient's behavior or restrict the patient's freedom of movement (i.e. to sedate the patient). ◦ Does not apply to medication that is a standard treatment or dosage to manage the patient's condition. The distinction between a medication restraint and a PRN medication used for behavioral control lies in the circumstances under which the medication is offered and the purpose for which it is being offered; examples include but are not limited to: ▪ Standing and PRN medications used as part of the patient's overall management at standard doses and taken voluntarily by the patient with the goal of helping the patient self-regulate, achieve calmness, and appropriately interact with others. ▪ A standing or stat PRN offered to the patient, if it is being offered to help the patient avoid further escalation, and the patient accepts the medication voluntarily. • Ordering Clinician ◦ Physician, Advanced Practice Registered RN (APRN), or Physician Assistant • Physical Restraint ◦ Any manual method, physical or mechanical device, material, or equipment that is used for the purpose of immobilizing or substantially reducing the ability of a patient to move his or her arms, legs, body, or head freely. ◦ When a mechanical device or devices are used to restrain a patient by restricting the movement of a patient or the movement of normal function of a portion of his or her body for a non-clinical purpose, this includes but is not limited to: ▪ The use of a ""net bed"" that prevents the patient from freely exiting the bed is considered a restraint, unless used as developmentally appropriate protective equipment for patient safety. ▪ IMitts are considered restraint if they are pinned down; applied so tightly that the patient's fingers or hands are immobilized, or if the ability to use the hands is significantly reduced. ▪ Mechanical devices that may be considered protective equipment or used for medical immobilization or in other medical contexts, are considered restraints when used on an inpatient psychiatric unit as the clinical purpose in this setting usually meets the definition of a physical restraint. • Restraint for Non-Violent/Non-Self-Destructive Behavior ◦ A restraint used to prevent removal or disturbance of critical medical/surgical devices or operative repair sites. ◦ Use is limited to clinical situations in which less restrictive interventions are determined to be ineffective or inappropriate. Examples include, but are not limited to: ▪ Removal of tubes (e.g., Nasogastric, central lines, or endotracheal) ▪ Removal of lines (e.g., IV or central venous catheters) ▪ Removal of medical appliances (e.g., drainage devices, EEG leads) ▪ Injury to operative sites or treatment areas (e.g., sterile dressing) • Restraint for Violent/Self-destructive Behavior ◦ A mechanical, physical, and/or chemical (medication) restraint used for the management of aggressive, violent, or self-destructive behavior that imminently jeopardizes the physical safety of the patient, staff, or others. ◦ Does not apply to physical holds used during developmentally appropriate temper tantrums in young children or comfort measures with an infant, toddler, or preschool-aged children. • Seclusion ◦ The involuntary confinement of a patient alone in a room or area from which the patient is physically prevented from leaving. Seclusion may only be used for the management of violent or self- destructive behavior. ◦ Does not apply to timeouts, in which the patient consents to be alone in a designated area for an agreed-upon timeframe and is not prevented from leaving.","• Decision-making about life-sustaining treatment is considered a shared responsibility between the health care team and the family, which is consistent with Children's Hospital Boston's (CHB) philosophy of family-centered patient care. • In general, parents have the responsibility to make health care decisions for their minor children. • Adult patients have the responsibility to make their own decisions regarding life-sustaining treatments unless they are deemed incompetent to do so. • Children and adolescents who have attained a sufficient cognitive and developmental level to understand and evaluate their treatment options are generally given substantial consideration in the decision-making process. ◦ Note: For more information, see the related content listed below. • Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is initiated in the event of sudden or impending death unless there is a properly executed Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) Order to the contrary.",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
According to the hospitals Standard Precautions policy what are the primary strategies for preventing and controlling healthcareassociated infections,0,"1. Standard Precautions are the primary strategy for prevention and control of healthcare-associated infection and are followed in the care of ALL patients in the hospital regardless of their diagnosis or presumed infection status. a. Standard Precautions are designed to reduce the risk of transmission of microorganisms from both recognized and unrecognized sources of infection in health care facilities. Standard Precautions apply to: b. Blood c. All body fluids, secretions, and excretions except sweat and tears d. Non-intact skin e. Mucous membranes","Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) are an important problem in healthcare facilities in the United States and the world. Preventing transmission of these organisms is a key priority of infection prevention and control programs. The following provides a rational approach for managing patients who are known to harbor MDRO, based upon the setting of care. 1. Use Contact Precautions for any patient with colonization or infection with a multidrug resistant organism when: ◦ The patient is admitted to the hospital. ◦ The patient is seen in the Emergency Department. ◦ The patient is seen in a high-risk ambulatory setting that performs invasive procedures, e.g., ▪ CATCR and Waltham Infusion Center ▪ Gastroenterology Procedures Unit (GPU) ▪ Cardiac Catheterization Lab ▪ Interventional Radiology ▪ Other imaging with sedation ▪ Dialysis ▪ OR and PACU 2. Use Standard Precautions only for patients who are known to be colonized with a MDRO in low risk ambulatory settings (i.e., primary care, pre-op clinic and specialty clinics). Ensure gown and glove use for contact with pressure ulcers, draining wounds, uncontrolled secretions, stool incontinence and ostomy bags. ◦ Exception : Use Enhanced Contact Precautions for all patients with CF (cystic fibrosis) in all settings of care. 3. Use transmission-based precautions (i.e., Droplet , Contact , Airborne ) in all settings of care as needed for patients who are known or suspected to be infected by microorganisms spread by airborne, droplet or contact transmission. Transmission-based precautions are always used in addition to Standard Precautions","CH Employees/Staff Follow the requirements of Standard Precautions. Supervisor/ Ensure implementation of Standard Precautions and employee Department Management knowledge and compliance. Assure adequate supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) Infection Prevention and Educate staff on Standard Precautions policy. Control Department Serve as a resource for questions. Provide consultation regarding personal protective equipment, patient placement, and implementation of Standard Precautions. Occupational Health Serve as a resource for questions. Provide education to new employees on Standard Precautions policy during pre-placement screening.","1. Any patient on Inpatient Psychiatry or WCBAT, who has or develops symptoms consistent with a communicable disease, should be placed in a single room on the appropriate transmission-based isolation precautions. Decisions regarding patient care and disposition are coordinated between the unit attending and the nursing supervisor, and, if necessary, in consultation with Infection Prevention and Control. 2. The suspension of Contact Precautions and Enhanced Contact Precautions apply only while the patient is physically on Inpatient Psychiatry or WCBAT. ◦ If a patient with CF or a patient colonized with a multidrug-resistant organism (as defined by Infection Prevention and Control) needs to leave the unit for testing or treatment in another area of the hospital, Enhanced Contact Precautions and/or Contact Precautions, as appropriate for the condition/infection, must be in effect at all times while the patient is outside of Inpatient Psychiatry or WCBAT . Notify destination departments in advance of the patient's arrival to use transmission- based precautions. 3. A single room is preferred for patients with a known history of colonization or infection with a multidrug- resistant organism or CF. If a single room is unavailable, consult with Infection Prevention and Control. 4. Educate patients about respiratory hygiene, cough etiquette and hand hygiene. 5. In selected situations, Standard Precautions alone may not be adequate for patients who are colonized or infected with multidrug-resistant organisms. Some examples include the following: ◦ Use Contact Precautions for i. A patient with MRSA colonization of the nares who has a concurrent respiratory tract infection (add Droplet Precautions as needed). ii. A patient with MRSA colonization of the skin who has active skin infection that cannot be covered or contained by a dressing. iii. A patient with VRE colonization in the gastrointestinal tract who has diarrhea and/or is incontinent of stool. iv. A patient with a Foley catheter-associated urinary tract infection caused by a resistant organism. v. A patient with a tracheostomy who is colonized with multidrug-resistant organisms in the respiratory tract and is unable to handle secretions (i.e., cover their cough with tissue, dispose of tissue appropriately and perform hand hygiene after tissue disposal). 6. Patients being managed using Standard Precautions only may use the common areas, recreational areas, and dining facilities within the unit. Supervision of hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette should be provided as necessary. 7. Precaution flag(s) for transmission-based precautions will be maintained in the banner bar of Powerchart and within EPIC for communication to other hospital locations. 8. For patients being managed using Standard Precautions only, no Precautions signs are necessary while on Inpatient Psychiatry or WCBAT. It is also unnecessary for staff to wear gowns and gloves to enter the patient's room. 9. Consult Infection Prevention and Control in any situation in which management using Standard Precautions is problematic (e.g. uncooperative behavior). Consideration will be given to the individual patient's needs and level of supervision required. 10. Patients on Contact Precautions may leave their rooms for essential purposes only. If the patient's attending physician considers group therapy essential for the patient's treatment and rehabilitation, then the patient may be allowed to attend the session after consultation with Infection Prevention and Control. However, there are selected circumstances in which patients should remain in their rooms. These include: ◦ Patients with fever until the fever resolves. ◦ Patients with diarrhea until the diarrhea resolves. ◦ Patient with untreated ectoparasites, e.g, lice or scabies, until 24 hours after appropriate treatment is administered. ◦ Patients with uncontrolled wound drainage. ◦ Patients with respiratory tract infections who are unable or unwilling to contain their secretions. 11. Patients on Contact Precautions should have the appropriate sign placed on the door and should be placed in a single room. Discontinuation of Contact Precautions should be done in accordance with Infection Prevention and Control policy. 12. Each patient's clothing should be washed and dried separately from that of other patients. Clothing may be washed using water temperatures that are consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations. The washer and dryer should be wiped down with a hospital-approved disinfectant weekly or when visibly soiled. No special wash cycle is required for patients colonized or infected with multidrug-resistant organisms. 13. Contact Infection Prevention and Control for guidance (for instance, multiple cases of gastroenteritis in patients or staff within a short time period) whenever a cluster of infections is suspected.","• Contact Precautions are needed for all inpatient admissions, ED visits, and high-risk ambulatory settings that perform invasive procedures • Confirm the patient has multidrug resistant organism (MDRO) Contact Precautions listed in the banner bar • Standard Precautions are to be followed for patients who are known to be colonized with a MDRO coming through the PCCC ◦ Ensure gown and glove use for contact with pressure ulcers, draining wounds, uncontrolled secretions, stool incontinence, and ostomy bags ◦ Note contact precautions in the PAEF ""Special Needs"" list • Refer to Infection Prevention Control Manual Entry for Management of Patients with MDRO as noted below in ""Related Content"" for further details",4,4,4,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
What criteria must a patient meet in order to be transferred from the PACU to an inpatient unit as outlined in the hospital policies,1,"1. Before the patient's discharge from the PACU, the PACU nurse provides postoperative teaching and care information to the patient/family. a. The patient may be discharged from the PACU to home once they meet discharge guidelines as per Discharge guidelines for ambulatory surgery patients and they are back to baseline and/or meet Modified Aldrete Score criteria as above. This is documented in the Post-Anesthesia Recovery Score section in the flowsheet of PowerChart. 2. Patients who are classified as ASA I or II and meet criteria may be discharged by nursing per Discharge guidelines for ambulatory surgery patients , or an attending anesthesiologist or anesthesia fellow assesses/authorizes each patient discharge as appropriate. The anesthesiologist enters the Anesthesia Sign-Out order with an accompanying note in PowerChart.","1. The PACU nurse gives verbal/telephone report to the unit nurse using the IPASS report tool before transfer. 2. The PACU nurse notifies the unit of special equipment and/or patient considerations, and provides an estimated time of arrival. 3. The unit nurse reviews PACU documentation in PowerChart. The anesthesia record can be viewed under Perioperative handoff in PowerChart. 4. The PACU nurse completes the discharge summary before transfer to the inpatient unit. If a patient's transfer is delayed due to a lack of a bed availability and/or a nurse, the nurse documents the discharge readiness time and reason for delay in PowerChart. Upon transfer from the PACU, a discharge assessment, pain score, IVFs infused are documented in PowerChart and discharge time is documented in PowerChart. The PACU documents the name of the receiving nurse. 5. Upon arrival to the floor, the nurse-to-nurse report includes identifying the patient as described in Patient Care Manual: Patient Identification , assessing the patient, checking the PCA or epidural/regional catheter settings, assessing the IV site, and viewing the operative site. The receiving nurse then follows the Patient Care Manual: Patient Admission policy.","1. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Class one and two patients (ASA 1 & ASA 2; scoring system appended) can be discharged by the PACU nursing staff if the patient was scheduled as a Day Surgery/Ambulatory patient, the PAR score is a 9 or a 10, the aforementioned criteria are met and there is an order for ""Post Anesthesia Discharge Protocol for Ambulatory Surgery Patients"". a. For these patients, the PACU nurse determines that the patient meets the discharge criteria. b. A second PACU nurse double checks all criteria are met prior to the patient being discharged. The name of the anesthesiologist accepting responsibility for discharge is noted on the record. 2. The PACU nurse can request anesthesia consultation and/or request a discharge note if it is felt to be in the best interest of the patient. If the patient has had any abnormality in their peri-operative course or is on a special protocol (e.g., post-angiogram) the patient is discharged by an anesthesiology fellow or attending. 3. ASA PS class 1 and 2 patients who have a PAR score of 8, due to preoperative BP not recorded may still qualify for a 2 nurse sign-out. a. The PACU nurse consults with the responsible anesthesiologist to ensure they are in agreement. b. Preoperative BP measurement and recording is the standard. These situations are the exception and not the norm. 4. ASA PS class 1 and 2 patients who underwent mask anesthesia for myringotomy tube placement may have their final BP in PACU deferred. These patients with a PAR score of 8 would meet criteria for a 2 nurse sign-out. 5. Patients who did not receive care from the Department of Anesthesiology, Critical Care and Pain Medicine are discharged by the surgical or medical service that performed the procedure with the responsible attending noted. 6. All other patients that do not meet the previously mentioned criteria are discharged by a fellow or staff anesthesiologist after reviewing the patient's status and medical record. a. Enter An anesthesia sign-out order and accompanying note into Surginet per anesthesia. b. If the patient does not meet the entire above criteria, discharge is at the discretion of the anesthesiologist in consultation with the primary surgical (procedural) service. c. Arrange appropriate follow up.","1. The OR and PACU nurse check the identification band before report is given as per Patient Identification . 2. The OR nurse is responsible for a complete report to the PACU nurse in IPASS format and include: a. Patient's weight, allergies (or NKDA) b. Medications given, ex. Acetaminophen/Ketorolac/local anesthetic/antibiotic c. Tubes/drains d. Heparin locks, CVL-include time of flush and concentration of Heparin e. Blood products available f. Special needs/personal belongings g. Surgical procedure and dressing applied 3. The anesthesia provider will provide a complete report of the intra-operative and anesthetic care to the primary PACU nurse (See Guidelines for Content of Intraoperative Report by Anesthesiologist/ Anesthetist) after it is determined that the patient is stable by anesthesia and PACU nursing. 4. The PACU nurse will document pertinent events, observations, or interventions that occurred during the procedure as reported by the anesthesia provider into the PACU electronic documentation. PACU Nurse Responsibilities during PACU Stay 1. The effects of both anesthesia and surgery disrupt normal physiologic functioning and stability, which result in the potential for alterations of or impairment of: a. Consciousness b. Gas exchange and ability to sustain spontaneous ventilation c. Cardiac output d. Effective airway clearance e. Breathing patterns f. Fluid volume/electrolyte disturbance g. Tissue perfusion h. Skin integrity i. Sensory/perceptual ability j. Thermoregulatory ability k. Comfort It also produces: l. Fear/anxiety m. Potential for injury from both iatrogenic and environmental sources n. Alterations in family process Additionally, patients and families experience a lack of knowledge of post-surgical/post- anesthetic management and practices. This may contribute to or exacerbate both fear and anxiety. 5. The PACU nurse will provide intensive monitoring of patients following the administration of an anesthetic (general, regional or sedation) in conjunction with surgery or other diagnostic/therapeutic intervention. An ongoing and continuous assessment is conducted for each patient during the PACU stay. 6. Based on data collected during monitoring of the patient and data obtained from other disciplinary sources, the PACU nurse: a. Assesses patient vital signs and condition, noting alterations and trends. Assesses vital signs every 15 minutes for the first hour of PACU stay or until the Modified Aldrete Score criteria is met. See Guidelines for Documentation in the PACU . b. Assesses patient for any changes in patient condition c. Plans appropriate nursing treatments and interventions to achieve restoration of functional stability d. Reassesses efficacy of treatment and interventions e. Identifies trends and outcomes in patient care methods and identifies areas for ongoing quality assurance monitoring f. Provides appropriate safeguards for the patient to minimize the potential for injury g. Uses side rails h. Uses appropriate size stretcher/crib i. Ensures that bed/stretcher/crib is clear of instrumentation/objects which may produce physical harm j. Positions patient appropriately in a manner that prevents injury from improper positioning 7. The PACU nurse reunites the patient/family as soon as possible based on the condition and needs of the patient without compromising other patient care needs. Transfer of Care to an Inpatient Unit 8. The patient is transferred from the PACU to an inpatient unit once the patient has met Modified Aldrete Score criteria, which scores the patient in the categories of activity, respiratory, circulation, consciousness, and oxygen saturation (see Post-Anesthesia Recovery Score section in the flowsheet of PowerChart). The patient will demonstrate adequate/acceptable: a. airway clearance b. gas exchange and respiratory function c. level of consciousness d. cardiac output e. fluid volume/electrolyte balance f. tissue perfusion g. skin integrity h. sensory/perceptual abilities, sensory/motor capability i. thermoregulatory ability j. Minimal pain/nausea & vomiting/bleeding 9. An attending anesthesiologist or designee assesses and authorizes each patient transfer to an inpatient unit once the patient has achieved satisfactory scores on the discharge-scoring tool. The anesthesiologist will enter an Anesthesia Sign-Out order in PowerChart.","• Upon admission, a licensed practitioner (MD, PA, NP, House Officer, DMD/DDS) enters an ""Admission order"", selecting either ""Inpatient"" or ""Observation"" services. ◦ Level of Care is located on the banner bar in PowerChart. If unsure of the Level of Care, call Case Management with questions. • If the licensed practitioner who initiated the order does not have admitting privileges, the order is routed to Attending Physician with admitting privileges for signature. The attending of record may need to sign off on any of the following: ◦ Admit to inpatient orders for newly admitted patients ◦ Admit to observation orders for newly admitted patients • If the patient is observation but the MD order is inpatient, cancel the inpatient order first then place a new observation order to sign. ◦ Encounter level of care orders for patients changed from observation to inpatient or inpatient to observation ◦ The attending physician must certify that the services were ordered in accordance with the Medicare regulations governing the order. The certification must include the reasons for hospitalization, estimated length of stay, and plans for post-hospital care (if applicable). • Orders must be signed prior to discharge by an attending physician with admitting privileges who is knowledgeable about the patient's hospital course, medical plan of care, and current condition. The attending must ensure the documentation (including trainee documentation) explains why the patient requires inpatient or observation level care based on complexity, co-morbidities, severity of symptoms etc. • If an order for signature is sent to the wrong attending, the attending should: ◦ Refuse the order in PowerChart and reroute to appropriate attending. ◦ If the attending has a question on the level of care, they can contact the Case Managers. • Level of Care Changes • If a level of care change is necessary based on InterQual criteria (either inpatient to observation or observation to inpatient), the Case Manager recommends a class change by initiating an order to be signed by the attending physician. The physician has the ability to refuse the change and contact Case Management with questions. • If the severity of illness changes, a case manager or physician involved in case may change a patient from observation to inpatient level of care. Place a new admission order and indicate the new level of care. • Case Manager Review • Case Managers review inpatients on admission and upon payer requirements. • Case Managers review observation patients daily, with the exception of holidays.",4,4,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
How often should a consent be reviewed and updated for outpatient services and under what circumstances would a new consent be required for recurrent treatments and procedures,0,"• For inpatient services, consent is valid for the duration of the hospital stay, both during and following the procedure, intervention, or treatment. If there is a significant change in the patient's condition that would reasonably be expected to alter the treatment plan or require additional procedures (that was not identified or discussed with the patient as part of the initial consent), a new consent may need to be obtained for the subsequent treatment. • For outpatient services, the consent remains in effect throughout the course of continuing services, provided the patient is continuing the same or similar recommended procedure, intervention, or treatment for the same initial diagnosis. There is a general standard that a consent should be reviewed and updated on an annual basis to determine if the course of treatment or evaluation being provided has changed since the initial consent was signed. • When the treatment plan involves recurrent treatments and procedures, a consent is not required for each repetitive treatment/procedure, unless there is a significant deviation from the original plan, the patient's condition or diagnosis changes from the initial intent of the consent (which was not something identified or discussed with the patient and/or the parent/guardian as part of the initial consent form), or different treatments are being provided during the recurring treatment plan. • There is no specified or standard time period in which a consent should be obtained prior to a procedure. If the provider's practice is that the consent is normally obtained at a specified period prior to the planned procedure, intervention or treatment, (e.g., one week, one month, longer) the provider should maintain those practices.","For studies initiated after the effective date of the GDS policy, NIH expects investigators to obtain participants' consent for their genomic and phenotypic data to be used for future research purposes and to be shared broadly. This also includes specimens used to generate a cell line as well. This informed consent requirement includes collection of clinical specimens used for research as well as specimens obtained specifically for research – both identifiable as well as de-identified. It is important to note that under this new policy, de-identified excess clinical specimens can no longer be considered non-human subject research. Also, a waiver of informed consent can longer be allowed. This is a major change and requires that investigators obtain consent in cases where previously was not necessary. In addition, it will be required to specify that samples and data may be used for unspecified and broad research topics not limited to the condition for which a subject is receiving care. Obtaining informed consent and specifying broad use will give investigators the greatest amount of flexibility in the future.","HHS (45 CFR 46.117(c)) and FDA (21 CFR 56.109(c)(1)) allow the IRB to waive written informed consent for research that meets specific regulatory criteria. 1. For HHS funded research (45 CFR 46.117(c)), the IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds either: a. That the only record linking the subject and the research would be the informed consent form and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. b. Each subject (or legally authorized representative) will be asked whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the research, and the subject's wishes will govern; i. That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context; or ii. If the subjects or legally authorized representatives are members of a distinct cultural group or community in which signing forms is not the norm, that the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and provided there is an appropriate alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained. 2. For FDA regulated research (21 CFR 56.109(c)(1)), the IRB may only waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds: a. That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context. 3. The investigator is required to justify in the protocol how the conditions for waiver of documentation are to be met. 4. The procedure for waiving the requirement for documentation is not intended to circumvent the requirement for informed consent but rather to protect patient privacy. All required information must still be presented and discussed to ensure a voluntary informed consent process. 5. In cases in which the documentation requirement is waived (referred to as ""obtained through a method other than a written document"" in Boston Children's Hospital IRB application and approval materials), the IRB will often require the investigator to provide subjects with written information about the research.","FDA CFR 50.24 The IRB responsible for the review, approval, and continuing review of the clinical investigation described in this section may approve that investigation without requiring that informed consent of all subjects be obtained if the IRB (with the concurrence of a licensed physician who is a member of the IRB and who is not otherwise participating in the clinical investigation, if subject to FDA regulations) finds and documents each of the following: 1. The human subjects are in a life-threatening situation, available treatments are unproven or unsatisfactory, and the collection of valid scientific evidence, which may include evidence obtained through randomized placebo-controlled investigations, is necessary to determine the safety and effectiveness of particular interventions. 2. Obtaining informed consent is not feasible because: a. The subjects will not be able to give their informed consent as a result of their medical condition. b. The intervention under investigation must be administered before consent from the subject's legally authorized representatives is feasible; and c. There is no reasonable way to identify prospectively the individuals likely to become eligible for participation in the clinical investigation. 3. Participation in the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the subjects because: a. Subjects are facing a life-threatening situation that necessitates intervention; b. Appropriate animal and other preclinical studies have been conducted, and the information derived from those studies and related evidence support the potential for the intervention to provide a direct benefit to the individual subjects; and c. Risks associated with the investigation are reasonable in relation to what is known about the medical condition of the potential class of subjects, the risks and benefits of standard therapy, if any, and what is known about the risks and benefits of the proposed intervention or activity. 4. The clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out without the waiver. 5. The proposed investigation plan defines the length of the potential therapeutic window based on scientific evidence, and the investigator has committed to attempting to contact a legally authorized representative for each subject within that window of time and, if feasible, to ask the legally authorized representative contacted for consent within that window rather than proceeding without consent. The investigator will summarize efforts made to contact a legally authorized representative and make this information available to the IRB at the time of continuing review. 6. The IRB has reviewed and approved informed consent procedures and an informed consent document. These procedures and the informed consent document are to be used with subjects or their legally authorized representatives in situations where use of such procedures and documents is feasible. The IRB has reviewed and approved procedures and information to be used when providing an opportunity for a family member to object to a subject's participation in the clinical investigation consistent with paragraph (7)(v) below. 7. Additional protections of the rights and welfare of the subjects will be provided, including, at least: i. Consultation (including, where appropriate, consultation carried out by the IRB) with representatives of the communities in which the clinical investigation will be conducted and from which the subjects will be drawn; ii. Public disclosure to the communities in which the clinical investigation will be conducted and from which the subjects will be drawn, prior to initiation of the clinical investigation, of plans for the investigation and its risks and expected benefits; iii. Public disclosure of sufficient information following completion of the clinical investigation to apprise the community and researchers of the study, including the demographic characteristics of the research population, and its results; iv. Establishment of an independent data monitoring committee to exercise oversight of the clinical investigation; and v. If obtaining informed consent is not feasible and a legally authorized representative is not reasonably available, the investigator has committed, if feasible, to attempting to contact within the therapeutic window the subject's family member who is not a legally authorized representative, and asking whether he or she objects to the subject's participation in the clinical investigation. The investigator will summarize efforts made to contact family members and make this information available to the IRB at the time of continuing review. a. The IRB is responsible for ensuring that procedures are in place to inform, at the earliest feasible opportunity, each subject, or if the subject remains incapacitated, a legally authorized representative of the subject, or if such a representative is not reasonably available, a family member, of the subject's inclusion in the clinical investigation, the details of the investigation and other information contained in the informed consent document. The IRB shall also ensure that there is a procedure to inform the subject, or if the subject remains incapacitated, a legally authorized representative of the subject, or if such a representative is not reasonably available, a family member, that he or she may discontinue the subject's participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled. If a legally authorized representative or family member is told about the clinical investigation and the subject's condition improves, the subject is also to be informed as soon as feasible. If a subject is entered into a clinical investigation with waived consent and the subject dies before a legally authorized representative or family member can be contacted, information about the clinical investigation is to be provided to the subject's legally authorized representative or family member, if feasible. b. The IRB determinations required by § 50.25(a) of this section and the documentation required by § 50.25(e) of this section are to be retained by the IRB for at least 3 years after completion of the clinical investigation, and the records shall be accessible for inspection and copying by FDA in accordance with § 56.115(b). c. Protocols involving an exception to the informed consent requirement under this section must be performed under a separate investigational new drug application (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE) that clearly identifies such protocols as protocols that may include subjects who are unable to consent. The submission of those protocols in a separate IND/IDE is required even if an IND for the same drug product or an IDE for the same device already exists. Applications for investigations under this section may not be submitted as amendments under § 312.30 or 812.35. d. If an IRB determines that it cannot approve a clinical investigation because the investigation does not meet the criteria in the exception provided under § 50.25(a) of this section or because of other relevant ethical concerns, the IRB must document its findings and provide these findings promptly in writing to the clinical investigator and to the sponsor of the clinical investigation. The sponsor of the clinical investigation must promptly disclose this information to FDA, when the project is under the jurisdiction of the FDA and to the sponsor's clinical investigators who are participating or are asked to participate in this or a substantially equivalent clinical investigation of the sponsor, and to other IRBs that have been, or are asked to review this or a substantially equivalent investigation by that sponsor. Additional HHS requirements: HHS 45 CFR 46.101(i): a. In accordance with HHS regulations the ""Emergency Research Consent Waiver"" does not apply to research involving prisoners, fetuses, pregnant women and human in vitro fertilization. b. The IRB must approve the research, waiver, and document that the research activity is subject to regulations codified by the FDA Title 21 CFR part 50 and will be carried out under an FDA investigational new drug application (IND) or an FDA investigational device exemption (IDE). The application for which has clearly identified the protocols that would include subjects who are unable to consent, and c. That: i. The requirements for exception from informed consent for emergency research detailed in title 21 CFR section 50.24 have been met relative to those protocols, or ii. The IRB responsible for the review, approval, and continuing review of the research has approved both the research and a waiver of informed consent and has found and documented that the research is not subject to regulations codified by the FDA at Title 21 CFR part 50 and found and documented and reported to the Office for Protection from Research Risks, HHS, that all the above mentioned conditions have been met relative to the research. *In accordance with HHS and for the purposes of this waiver, ""family member"" means any one of the following legally competent persons: spouses, parents, children (including adopted children), brothers, sisters, and spouses of brothers and sisters, and any individual related by blood or affinity whose close association with the subject is the equivalent of a family relationship.","The following is a summary of the justifications and steps that need to be taken in order to conduct emergency research protocols with a waiver of informed consent: 1. Protocol justification: Researchers must provide a detailed description in their protocol that: a. The human subject is in a life-threatening situation, available treatments are unproven or unsatisfactory, and the collection of valid scientific evidence is necessary to determine the safety and effectiveness of particular interventions; b. Obtaining informed consent is not feasible, for three reasons: i. Participation in the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the subjects, ii. The study could not practicably be carried out without the waiver of informed consent; and iii. The study defines the length of the potential therapeutic window and the investigator has committed to attempting to contact a legally authorized representative to ask for consent for each subject within that window of time. 2. Community consultation : Consultation with appropriate community representatives will need to occur before the research begins 3. Public disclosure : Appropriate public disclosure will need to occur prior to the initiation of the study as well at the completion of the study 4. Ongoing attempts to obtain consent : Researchers planning to conduct research that does not include the informed consent of all subjects must provide information and attempt to obtain the consent from the subjects and/or the appropriate relatives or legally authorized representatives on an ongoing basis throughout the conduct of the research and at the conclusion of the research. a. It is also required that information be provided about the clinical investigation to the subject's legally authorized representative or to a relative, if feasible, if the subject dies before consent has been obtained 5. Summaries of attempts to obtain consent : If obtaining informed consent is not feasible and a legally authorized representative is not reasonably available, investigators must document and summarize their attempts to contact family members to obtain their consent. a. This information will need to be submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing review. 6. A separate Investigational New Device (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) - if subject to FDA regulations : Protocols involving an exception to the informed consent requirement under this FDA regulation must be performed under a separate investigational new drug application (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE) that clearly identifies such protocols as protocols that may include subjects who are unable to consent. a. The submission of those protocols in a separate IND/IDE is required even if an IND for the same drug product or an IDE for the same device already exists. b. Applications for investigations under this section may not be submitted as amendments under 312.30 or 812.35. 7. Independent Data Monitoring Committee: An independent data monitoring committee will need to be established. a. Requests for research that fall within this emergency informed consent exemption often take longer periods of time to review, therefore investigators should plan ahead. b. Often, it will be necessary to arrange for meetings with the IRB Chair and administrative staff in addition to the IRB meetings. Other representatives from Boston Children's Hospital, such as public affairs may also need to be contacted and involved.",4,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
What is the process for handling a transport request in terms of communication responsibilities for the Communications Specialist,0,"The Communications Specialist (CS) that initially takes a transport request will be the CS that relays information to and from the Transport Team, the Medical Control Physician, and the referring facility. 1. The Communications Specialist that initiates the transport request will be the CS that communicates with the team throughout the transport. 2. If the CS who is handling a transport request answers an expect call while another CS is in the room, that call should be put on hold and handed off to the other CS, leaving the CS free to handle the transport call. 3. Should another CS answer a call that is related to the transport, the caller should be put on hold until the CS handling the transport is available to take the call. 4. All calls should be made through the dedicated transport phone line (5-2710) to ensure free use of the phone line and proper recording. a. See 03.07 Dedicated Transport Communications Phone Line","• The Communications Specialist (CS) will take only the initial information for a transport request and then connect the referring provider with the appropriate Medical Control Physician and the Crew Chief (when available) on the recorded line for report. • Purpose: The CS follows this policy to minimize the amount of time the referring provider is waiting on hold as well as to allow the best opportunity for information sharing among the referring provider, the Medical Control Physician, Crew Chief and Communications Specialist.","1. The Communications Specialist (CS) will take the initial information for a Mobile ECMO request and notify the appropriate team members of the request. 2. Purpose: a.

What program completion is necessary for a nurse to become a GI Associate according to the hospital policy,0,"Each policy statement should reflect the basic objectives of the organization and a description of the general guiding principles or rules. 1. Employees newly hired by the Department of Patient Care Services serve a review period according to Personnel Policy. All nursing employees are evaluated in writing at the end of their unit-based orientation period. a. This orientation evaluation documents the accomplishment of unit-based orientation. Staff who demonstrate achievement of unit-based orientation expectations are competent to care for patients commonly admitted to that unit at the completion of orientation. 2. Annually, from date of hire, each nursing employee's job performance is evaluated according to Personnel Policy . Staff are evaluated using performance criteria from their job description. 3. Employees are required to complete the Mandatory Yearly Review (MYR) process as described in Personnel Policy. 4. The employee's annual review date is used as the reference point for annual completion of MYRs. All completion records are maintained in NetLearning and can be found in individual employee transcripts. Employees are required to present a copy of their transcript at yearly review. 5. Evidence of continuing education and in-service education are reviewed at the annual performance evaluation. A plan for meeting identified learning needs is made. 6. The annual performance evaluation, including peer review serves to document on-going clinical competence. It also serves as the basis for re-appointment to a Staff Nurse I, II, or III position.","The primary goal of the MICU orientation program is to provide entry-level staff nurses with the knowledge and skills necessary to administer safe and competent care to our patients and their families. In general, experienced nurses receive 12 weeks of orientation made up of a variety of lectures, simulation, and hands on experience with a preceptor. The trajectory of orientation is based on the completion of all competencies and agreement between the nurse educator, preceptor and orientee as to the readiness of the orientee for independent practice. In-services and continuing education programs are provided to maintain staff competency. Staff in-services are offered both centrally and unit-based. These programs meet educational needs identified from a variety of sources including an annual staff education survey.","1. Verify patient transfer orders. Transfer orders are not needed if there is no service change (e.g. a GI patient going from GI on 10S to GI on 9S). 2. Confirm bed and unit in Capacity Management 3. Sending RN telephones the receiving unit nurse to negotiate a convenient time for transferring the patient and to perform the clinical handoff. See The Patient Care Manual: Clinician Handoffs for more information. 4. Explain transfer to the patient/family to promote understanding and cooperation. Whenever possible, the patient/family is oriented to the new unit prior to the transfer. 5. The nurse assembles patient belongings and medications, and any monitoring equipment necessary to ensure safety during transit to the new location. 6. Verify presence of patient's identification bracelet and/or allergy bracelet and transfer patient to new location. Upon transfer to new location, accepting clinician verifies patient identification. 7. The receiving unit transfers the patient in the computer system upon arrival and updates the service and attending physician.","If volunteer workers are needed, volunteer licensed independent practitioners (e.g. physicians, physician's assistants, or nurse practitioners) may be temporarily credentialed or privileged during a hospital declared disaster when they are necessary to meet immediate patient care needs.

How is heparinized plasmalyte added to the heparinized blood bag in the process described,1,"1. Turn the original venous line stopcock off to the venous line and add a second stopcock to the venous sampling/MUF boot connection stopcock. 2. Attach a male-male cell saver line to the stopcock of the blood quick prime side (below the SQ40s) and slowly and deliberately prime that line with cap removed. 3. Attach the primed cell saver line to the additional stopcock. 4. Turn the stopcock such that you may be able to burp out any bubbles by pulling the venous sampling syringe. 5. Place a dispensing pin on remaining unspiked port of the blood bag. 6. Disconnect CVR return line from stopcock on arterial boot and connect to the blood bag dispensing pin. 7. Add ~200 ml of heparinized plasmalyte to heparinized blood bag by clamping the common quick prime line, and lowering the blood bag to accept plasmalyte volume. 8. Reclamp both sides of the quick prime lines under the stopcocks. 9. Turn stopcock on prime line and venous stopcock so that cell saver line from blood bag is open to the muf boot circuit. 10. Review circuit from blood bag to cell saver line to muf boot to hemoconcentrator back to blood bag via pin. 11. Turn on active ultrafiltration head and hemoconcentrate volume added (may be done multiple times if needed).","1. If time permits, water test oxygenator in the usual way. 2. Attach prime line. Clamp line and spike a liter bag of heparinized Plasma-Lyte. Draw off 1 50 cc syringe of Plasma-Lyte to use when making connections in OR. 3. From the FUG pack, attach 3/8"" tubing X 3/8"" connectors to the oxygenator inlet and outlet. 4. Loosely attach the 1/2"" boot to the oxygenator connectors. Place a clamp on the boot near the reservoir outlet. 5. Attach a 3/8"" boot to the oxygenator outlet and run it to the reservoir. 6. Attach a stopcock to the oxygenator pigtail. Discard the manifold that comes with the reservoir. Attach oxygenator purge to reservoir. Keep the red cap on the ""cardioplegia port"". 7. Drop 1000 mL of heparinized Plasma-Lyte. Holding boot up, release the clamp on the reservoir outlet and fluid prime the oxygenator. Clamp the oxygenator purge line and burp the air out of the oxygenator pigtail stopcock, the cap on the ""cardioplegia port"", and the tubing on the oxygenator outlet. Turn the oxygenator pigtail stopcock to off position and clamp the tubing on the oxygenator outlet. 8. Place clamps on the oxygenator inlet and outlet FUG pack connections. Remove the loosely attached boot and maintain sterile connections with alcohol wipe packs. 9. Detach the oxygenator purge and put it to a stopcock in the off position. 10. Maintaining sterility, disconnect oxygenator from reservoir. You should have an oxygenator with 3/8"" inlet and outlet connectors with clamps near those connectors, a closed stopcock on the pigtail, a closed stopcock on the purge line, and a cap on the ""cardioplegia port"". Bring this into the operating room along with other prepared supplies.","• Bank blood is known to have nonphysiologic values for many electrolytes which can lead to an undesirable effect on hemodynamics once transfused (1-4). Cell saver washing of PRBC units has been shown to effectively control mediators of hemodynamic change seen with stored blood (2,5). Though, increased cell wall fragility and hemolysis after processing and during bypass may be seen (5,6). This can lead to excess free iron in the blood which has been associated with negative outcomes (7-12). Ultrafiltration of blood prior to transfusion can be used to correct known issues with bank blood. • The method below provides the perfusionist one option for correcting issues with bank blood before transfusion to the pump circuit (13-15). This is done using the blood bag as the reservoir, a blood spike pin, an additional stopcock, and the cell saver circuit blood line. In short, after transferring heparinized plasmalyte to the blood bag, the filtered blood from the bag is directed to the MUF circuit by way of a line from the stopcock of the quick prime line and returned to the blood bag by way of the (MUF) return line to a dispensing pin in the other port of the blood bag.","1. Gather necessary equipment and calculate total amount of blood to be drawn. If drawing ABG, whole blood sodium (Na), potassium (K), ionized calcium (Ca) use heparinized syringe to prevent clotting. 2. Do not draw glucose levels from umbilical vessel catheters with glucose infusing as levels may be inaccurate. 3. Explain procedure to the patient and/or family to promote understanding and cooperation. 4. Perform hand hygiene and don clean gloves. 5. Remove waste by a closed blood-sampling system (recommended method): ◦ Close the distal valve by turning the handle perpendicular to the tubing. ◦ Draw up clearing volume (2-3mL) into reservoir using plunger at a rate of 1mL every 15 seconds. ◦ Close the proximal valve 6. Do one of the following: For arterial blood gases, whole blood Na, K or Ion Ca: ◦ Swab injection site with alcohol, use sampling cannula to access proximal port of closed blood- sampling system, and attach heparinized syringe to withdraw minimum of 0.3ml of blood. ◦ Dispel any air from the syringe and cover. ◦ Gently rotate syringe several times; label blood specimen at point of service and insert in plastic biohazard bag. For routine bloods: ◦ Swab injection site with alcohol, use empty syringe and sample cannula to access proximal port of system to withdraw amount of blood needed for samples. ◦ Fill and label blood specimen tubes at point of service and insert in plastic biohazard bag. 7. Return waste using blood-sampling system: ◦ Open proximal valve and return blood from reservoir. Plunger is pushed down all the way to the bottom. ◦ Open proximal valve and flush line with heparinized saline on pump. An alternative flush method is to clamp off proximal valve and swab injection site on distal port with Chlorhexidine or alcohol per unit standard. Using sampling cannula on syringe insert normal saline flush. ◦ Open proximal valve and remove flush. ◦ Open distal valve 8. Observe for quality of arterial waveform. 9. Ensure lab requisitions attached to specimens and send to appropriate lab.",• The bypass circuit venous limb is drained with crystalloid back to the bypass cardiotomy venous reservoir. • ECMO team crystalloid primes the ECMO circuit in the standard fashion. • Add 50 ml of 5% albumin to the ECMO prime bag and recirculate. • Empty the prime bag as much as possible to minimize hemodilution once the CPB/cell saver washed blood is added. • Add 200-250ml of CPB pump blood (patient whole blood) and 250-350ml of cell saver washed PRBCs (or salvaged product) to the prime bag. The pump blood is heparinized while the cell saver blood is not. • Add 400 units of heparin. • Chase as much crystalloid out of the circuit as possible and recirculate. • Add 25 mEq sodium bicarbonate while recirculating. • Add 750 mg calcium gluconate while recirculating. • Continue recirculating and ventilate with 100% oxygen at 1 LPM for 2 minutes. • Run a circuit blood gas and make changes to the prime as needed. • Hand lines up to the field and commence ECMO per normal standard with a time-out before initiation.,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

What are the responsibilities of the nurse if an infant does not pass the hearing test prior to discharge according to the hospital policy,0,"The MD/NP determines if the infant's hearing screen was completed at the birth hospital. If the infant has not had a hearing screening at the birth hospital or if the infant requires a repeat screen as determined by the guidelines in this policy, the medical team: • informs the parent/legal guardian of the significance of the hearing screenings. • contacts Audiology (ext 5-6461 or via Newborn Hearing Screen Request in EHR) to alert of the need for the screening prior to discharge. The Audiology Assistant performs the hearing screen. The Audiologist: • Reports normal results in patient chart (paper, if applicable, and in EHR) and communicates results to the parent/legal guardian. If the parent/legal guardian is not available, results are conveyed via telephone and/or postal mail. • Reports abnormal results to the medical team and to the parent/legal guardian, and documents results in the EHR. A member of the medical team and/or the audiologist discusses with the parent/legal guardian abnormal results, the result implications, and need for further testing. The Audiologist gives a list of DPH-approved diagnostic test centers to the parent/legal guardian and instructs him/her to make a follow-up diagnostic audiological evaluation appointment at an approved test center. If the infant does not pass the hearing test prior to discharge, the nurse documents that the follow-up appointment has been scheduled on the Newborn Hearing Screening Test Result form located in the ""consults"" section of the patient's chart. • If the follow-up appointment has not been scheduled, the nurse assists the parent/legal guardian with this process and documents the time and date of the appointment on the appropriate line of the form.","1. Massachusetts requires all newborns to receive a hearing screening by three months of age, unless the parent/guardian objects to a screen based on sincerely held religious beliefs 2. Hearing Screening must occur at the birth hospital before initial discharge to home or at a referring hospital (if the newborn is directly transferred from the birth hospital) before initially discharged to home a. BCH clinicians should obtain and document in the patient's chart information from the transferring hospital if a hearing screen was performed and the results of such screen. If the screen was not successful, missed, or the infant did not pass prior to the transfer, BCH shall conduct the screen prior to initial discharge to home. b. BCH clinicians must notify the parent(s)/guardian(s) both orally and in writing if a heaing screening was not successful, missed, or the infant did not pass. If a repeat or further screening cannot occur prior to discharge, the parent(s)/guardian(s) should be informed in writing of the inability to test prior to discharge, and the following should occur: i. Notify the infant's primary care provider; and ii. An appointment should be made at a DPH approved screening center such as BCH (note based on lack of availability of appointments at available locations, parents can also be provided with a list of sites that conduct such diagnostic screening for their choice). 3. If an infant cannot be screened due to delayed physiological development or physiological instability (related to but not limited to an illness or premature birth) as determined by the treating clinician, the infant shall be screened prior to discharge and as early as the identified physiological development or stability will permit reliable screening. 4. If the infant is discharged to home prior to conducting the hearing screen, an appointment is made for a screen to be performed within 1 month of the infants birth (note based on lack of availability of appointments at available locations, parents can also be provided with a list of sites that conduct such diagnostic screening for their choice). a. The infant's primary care provider should be notified that a hearing screen is pending. Re-screening 5.

If the infant is transfused within 48 hours of specimen collection, a repeat specimen should be obtained 48 hours post transfusion. b. If the infant will be discharged to another facility, notify the receiving hospital when the most recent specimen was obtained. c. If there is a clinical concern about hypothyroidism, testing can be performed sooner than the standard intervals. d. Repeat specimens are collected immediately if the New England Newborn Screening Program at the Massachusetts State Lab reports abnormal results or indicates that a specimen is unsatisfactory for any reason. e.

How should nurses handle the related content processes when encountering them during their shift,0,"Staffing plans are developed based on the American Nurses Association principles of Nurse Staffing. The principles address patient care unit related, staff related and institution/organization related activities. Patient care related activities should reflect the needs of the patients, a staffing plan must consider the number of patients and the level of care required while incorporating physical and psychosocial limitations. For staff related activities, the principle needs of the patient populations should determine the competencies required of the nurse practicing. Staff skill mix and competencies, as well as leadership and organizational support guide this process. The hospital has policies to support the needs of patients and nursing staff. Thus, these policies recognize the myriad needs for both patients and nursing staff. The nurse staffing for 9 East includes registered nurses and clinical assistants. Registered nurses range in experience from new graduate nurses to several staff with over 30 years clinical practice on 9 East. Nurses on 9 East work 8 and 12 hour shifts to provide maximum support of the patient flow on the unit. As a medical unit, many patients are admitted in the afternoon and evening. The combination of 8 and 12-hour shifts provide additional staff during peak times. Unit resources such as administrative associates are considered when planning staffing. Staffing plans are arranged to accommodate the specific patient populations on 9 East. Staff are assigned patients based on consistency of care, experience, knowledge, and patient characteristics. The schedule is arranged by a registered nurse trained in assignment-making to ensure the appropriate mix of staff each shift seven days a week. The time scheduler ensures that there is a sufficient number of experienced staff on each shift so more experienced RNs are available as clinical resources to RNs with less proficiency. In addition, an RN specifically trained in the role of the charge nurse, is assigned on each shift as well as a Resource Nurse. The charge nurse provides management of the daily unit operations, serves as a clinical resource to staff and ensures that appropriate chain of command is initiated when necessary. The Resource Nurse partners with the Charge Nurse in the management of the daily unit operations while also serving as a clinical resource to staff. Approximately one third of the staff belong to the Leadership Group, which is comprised of Level II and Level III staff nurses who act as clinical leaders and participate in the development, implementation and evaluation of unit goals. The staff is supported by the Medicine Patient Services Programs; an education coordinator, two clinical coordinators, and a nursing director. Nurse Practitioners also are available in several sub-specialties. Our CCS team has a Clinical Nurse Specialist who provides bedside clinical support for patients/families and nurses. The Patient Care Coordinator, who is a Registered Nurse, is responsible for supporting discharge planning and utilization review process. Hospital supports such as Spectra-link phones, transport services, housekeeping, laboratory, and hospital workstations reduce time away from patient care. Evaluation of the staffing plans is ongoing, and uses trends in identified nurse-sensitive indicators to evaluate its effectiveness. Staffing plans also take into consideration CAMEOS (Complexity Assessment and Monitoring to Ensure Optimal Outcomes) Subsequently, ""changes in staffing levels, including changes in the overall number and/or mix of nursing staff, are based on the analysis of standardized, nursing-sensitive indicators. The effect evaluated using the same criteria"" (ANA, 1999).","Staffing plans are developed based on the American Nurses Association (ANA) principles of Nurse Staffing.

Staffing plans are arranged to accommodate the specific patient populations on 7 West. The charge nurse from the off going shift picks the assignment with input from the staff nurses based on experience, consistency and the mix of acuity of each patient. The use of the CAMEO tool is utilized to guide assignment making. The schedule is arranged by a registered nurse trained in assignment-making to insure the appropriate mix of staff each shift seven days a week. The time scheduler ensures that there is a sufficient number of experienced staff on each shift so more experienced RNs are available as clinical resources to RNs with less proficiency. In addition, an RN specifically trained in the role of the charge nurse is assigned on each shift. The charge nurse provides management of daily unit operations serves as a clinical resource to staff and insures that appropriate chain of command is initiated when necessary. A resource nurse role is available to support staff M-F on the day shift. Approximately one third of the staff belong to the Leadership Group, which is comprised of Level II and Level III staff nurses who act as clinical leaders and participate in the development, implementation and evaluation of unit goals. The staff is supported by the Pediatric Medical Services Programs Nurse Educator, a Nurse Manager and a Nursing Director. Nurse Practitioners also are available in several sub-specialties. The Case Manager who is a Registered Nurse responsible for supporting discharge planning and utilization review process is also part of the team. Hospital supports such as spectralink phones, housekeeping, laboratory, and hospital work stations reduce time away from patient care. Evaluation of the staffing plans is ongoing, and uses trends in identified nurse-sensitive indicators to evaluate its effectiveness. Subsequently, ""changes in staffing levels, including changes in the overall number and/or mix of nursing staff, are based on the analysis of standardized, nursing-sensitive indicators. The effect evaluated using the same criteria"" (ANA, 1999).","The model of care used is the Synergy Model . This model of care matches individual nurse competencies and the patient needs when assigning patients. In the ED, the primary focus is providing continuity of care with a family-centered approach. Patients have their care coordinated on a shift by shift basis by an appropriately experienced RN. Unit and hospital wide Patient Care Manual in conjunction with Emergency Services Patient Care Manual for the management of patients are used, evaluated and updated when appropriate. In the ED, nurses can be assigned to different roles including triage, flo-coordinator, charge nurse, site manager, and team nursing. Physician (MD) staffing is also done according to the team system with the goal of matching MD and RN assignments as much as possible, and creating systems and structures that support communication, collaboration and minimize unnecessary handoffs."," All employees that are required, as part of their job function, to handle oxygen are trained to understand expectations and processes during the handling, and/or storage of oxygen.  Employees will receive training via annual MYR.  Secure oxygen cylinders at all times in cylinder cabinets, racks, transport carriers, bed/stretcher holders or other devices designed for cylinder securement when not in use (oxygen cylinders are not to be left freestanding or unsecured).  Oxygen cylinders are to be secured in the appropriate-size portable transfer carriers or appropriately carried when dispensed to clinical areas and/or during patient transports.","• Affected areas should monitor e-mail for updates and information during the incident. • Consider utilizing deployed disaster phones. A small cache of mobile phones is available through the Command Center. • Individual departments should use runners when needed (Such as for Medical Records and Food Service. • The physician assigned to the clinical area must remain in the patient care area. • Consolidate messages or requests for departments such as Radiology, and Clinical Labs, and have them delivered at one time. • If only the beeper system is affected and 5-7243 [PAGE] is not available, the page operator will handle all pages manually.

What is the time frame for subsequent continuing reviews as determined by the IRB and what factors can influence this time frame,0,"Continuing reviews that meet the regulatory criteria for expedited review are not placed on the agenda for full IRB review. 1. Each continuing review is assigned a primary reviewer. a. A Reviewer Worksheet is provided and needs to be completed and submitted at the end of the meeting. The worksheet is structured so that the reviewer can determine whether the regulatory criteria continue to be met. 2. Through the CHeRP system, the primary reviewer is provided with a copy of the continuing review SmartForm. They also have access to the entire protocol, and associated materials, including study history (i.e. previous continuing reviews and Reportable Events). 3. The procedures listed above apply to the review and voting process for continuing reviews. 4. The IRB determines the time frame for the subsequent continuing review. a. The continuing review time period must be set to occur within 1 year of the approval date. b. The default is one year, unless the IRB votes otherwise. Protocols that require continuing review in accordance with the Revised Common Rule, effective January 19, 2019 and the protocols approved prior to that date are referenced in the IRB policy: Continuing Review and Administrative Updates.","Continuing Review Applicability Research approved prior to January 21, 2019 and all FDA regulated research approved before or after 1/21/ 2019. 1. Research approved at a convened IRB meeting or through expedited review prior to January 21, 2019 and all FDA regulated research will undergo continuing review. 2. Protocols originally approved at a convened IRB meeting may undergo expedited continuing review: a. When: i. The research is permanently closed to the enrollment of new subjects and ii. All the subjects have completed all research-related interventions; and iii. The research remains active only for long term follow-up of subjects; or b. Where no subjects have been enrolled and no additional risks have been identified; or c. Where remaining research activities are limited to data analysis 3. Continuing review may be conducted through expedited procedures, if: a. It is non-FDA regulated research, (not conducted under investigational new drug application or investigational device exemption), and b. Where the permitted expedited categories do not apply, but the IRB has determined and documented at a convened meeting that the research i. Involves no greater than minimal risk a nd ii. No additional risks have been identified. 4. Review will be conducted at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less than once per year. Time Interval Upon initial review of a protocol, the IRB determines the time interval for the next continuing review. Review must occur within 1-year of the last approval date for a protocol to remain active; however, the IRB may decide more frequent review is necessary. 1. Convened IRB : For a protocol reviewed by the convened IRB, continuing review must occur within 1 year of the protocol being approved at a convened IRB meeting. 2. Expedited Review : For a protocol approved under expedited review that still requires Continuing Review, the review must occur within 1 year of the date the IRB Chair or designated IRB member(s) provide initial approval. More Frequent Review More frequent review may be based on a specific time interval or on a requirement to report back after a specified number of participants have been studied. In making the determination that more frequent review is required, the IRB takes into consideration: 1. The risk of the protocol and 2. The type of information the IRB would like to receive in order to assure appropriate oversight on an ongoing basis. Criteria used to consider whether more frequent review is required includes the following : 1. High-risk protocols where there is concern about significant adverse events that may be permanent, irreversible, or disabling, or that may significantly compromise the research subject. 2. Protocols where the potential risks are completely unknown, unless the minutes document that approval is granted for 1 year. 3. Protocols that involve newborns that include conditions for which it is not possible to perform studies in older children. 4. Protocols submitted with data from preliminary studies that raise concern regarding the possibility of serious adverse events. If more frequent review is required, the investigator will be informed through the approval notification and the CHeRP system will be set to notify the investigator at the required time. At the time of continuing review, the convened IRB or expedited reviewer will assure that all criteria for approval of research continue to be met. Review Tracking The IRB administrative office is responsible for tracking continuing reviews and for notifying investigators when review is required. The Continuing Review SmartForm must be submitted and approved prior to the protocol's expiration date. Principal Investigators (PIs) must submit the continuing review with ample time for the IRB to address any needed questions and revisions. 1. Three months before the protocol's expiration, the CHeRP system will send an automated notice to the PI and research team. 2. If the continuing review is not received, then a. A second notice will be sent at 2 months before the expiration date. b. A third notice will be sent 1 month before the expiration date. Continuing Review: Expedited and Convened IRB Review Process Expedited Review Continuing reviews which qualify for expedited review may be reviewed through the expedited review procedures. Convened IRB All continuing reviews which do not qualify for expedited review are placed on the agenda for the convened IRB meeting. The IRB will use the same criteria and take the same actions described in the IRB policy, 1. One IRB reviewer is assigned to each continuing review. 2. No member with a conflict of interest may serve as a reviewer. 3. All members can access the continuing review submission via CHeRP. Through CHeRP, IRB members have electronic access to the complete IRB protocol file and relevant IRB minutes, including amendments/modifications, unanticipated problems, and previous continuing review approvals. 4. The Continuing Review SmartForm includes: a. The number of subjects accrued: i. Enrolled (signed consent form) ii. Withdrawn due to subject request iii. Withdrawn due to toxicity/adverse events iv. Lost to follow-up v. Completed study (without events leading to early termination) vi. Currently active on study vii. Other category b. Removed for ineligibility c. A summary of adverse events and any unanticipated problems that involve risks to subjects or others, and any withdrawal of subjects from the research or complaints about the research since the last IRB review. d. If applicable: i. A summary of any relevant recent literature and interim findings. ii. Data and safety monitoring reports may be submitted. iii. Any relevant multi-center trial reports. iv. Monitoring reports from sponsors. e. Any other relevant information, particularly information about risks associated with the research. f. Links to the currently approved protocol, recruitment documents, and informed consent documents. g. Information regarding reliance arrangements 5. IRB members are provided with a continuing review Reviewer Worksheet to complete. When reviewing the current informed consent document, the IRB ensures that : a. The currently approved or proposed consent document is still accurate and complete; and b. Any significant new findings that may relate to the subject's willingness to continue to participate are provided to the subject. 6. The IRB may request and rely on a current statement from the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) or the sponsor that indicates it has reviewed study-wide adverse events, interim findings, and any recent literature that may be relevant to the research, in lieu of requiring that this information be submitted directly to the IRB. 7. In general, when taking an action of conditional approval at the time of continuing review, any noted conditions need to be satisfied before an investigator may continue research activities related to the conditions specified. a. During the continuing review, the IRB may make determinations that currently enrolled subjects may continue, but no new subjects may be enrolled until a designated IRB member reviews a revised protocol and verifies that conditions are met. 8. After the convened IRB meeting, the investigator is sent notification of the action taken. a. When approved, the informed consent dates are modified to reflect the new period of approval and expiration.","Initial Reporting 1. Principal Investigators (PIs) are responsible for promptly reporting all suspected incidents of noncompliance that could potentially be considered serious or continuing within 72 hours of being known. a. If the PI has any question whether a non-compliant event/deviation should be reported, they should contact the IRB. b. Deviations or departures from the IRB-approved protocol that do not have the potential for being considered serious or continuing noncompliance must still be documented by the investigator as part of their own study records and a summary or list of these events should be submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing review. 2. PIs or any other person may make an initial report via email, in person, or verbally, but must follow up with a written report using the Reportable Event form in CHeRP . a. If the report is made outside of CHeRP, then the report should be sent to the IRB Chair, the Senior Director of Clinical Research Compliance, or the Institutional Official. Deviations that are possibly noncompliant Deviations, divergences, or departures from IRB protocols that are thought to possibly be serious or continuing are submitted using the IRB form: Reportable Event . 1. The Senior Director of Clinical Research Compliance is responsible for screening the event and obtaining any additional information that may be required for initial consideration of the event. 2. The event is then reviewed by the IRB Chair. a. The IRB chair may request additional information as required and will make a determination as to whether the report should be submitted to the full IRB for a final determination on whether the event meets criteria for serious or continuing noncompliance. b. Issues such as whether the event was under the control of the investigator will be considered in making this determination. c. If the event is determined to be serious or continuing noncompliance, the Reportable Events policy will be followed. Violation of regulations, institutional policy, or conditions imposed by the IRB If the event submitted is a violation of: 1. Any regulation that governs human subject research 2. Any institutional policy for human subjects' research 3. Conditions imposed by the IRB on the approval of the study or conduct of the research. Responsibilities: IRB, PI, and Institutional Official Senior Director of Clinical Research and IRB Chair Responsibilities The Senior Director of Clinical Research Compliance is responsible for screening the event and obtaining any additional information that may be required for initial consideration of the event. The IRB Chair and the Senior Director will then discuss the following: 1. The incident and the facts presented to date. 2. Identification of those individuals involved in the incident or likely to be involved in the investigation and resolution of the incident. 3. If necessary, a meeting will be scheduled as soon as possible after the incident is reported (within 72 hours, when feasible) to begin to discuss and resolve the incident. a. Attendees may include the investigator(s), the investigator's Department/Division Chief, the IRB Chair, the Senior Director of Clinical Research Compliance, General Counsel, the Institutional Official, and any other staff member thought to be involved in the noncompliant incident and required resolution. 4. Whether there are sufficient facts to demonstrate serious or continuing noncompliance that is reportable in accordance with the Reportable Events policy. a. If so this will be immediately reported to the IRB who, based on a completed investigation, will make a final determination. i. If the IRB determines it is serious or continuing noncompliance the Reportable Events policy will be followed. ii. In most cases, more information will be required before a determination is made that the event is either serious or continuing noncompliance The IRB Chair may also: 1. Determine that the incident does not meet potential criteria for serious or continuing noncompliance and require either no further action or compliance with a corrective action plan that is acceptable to the Chair and agreed upon by the investigator. 2. Require that preliminary steps be immediately taken to further investigate and begin to correct the noncompliant incident and report to the IRB. 3. Determine the incident to represent serious or continuing noncompliance and recommend to the IRB that the protocol be suspended or terminated in whole or in part. This step may be taken as a final measure or as an interim measure where investigatory conclusions, although incomplete, are conclusive enough in pertinent part to just IRB action. Convened IRB Responsibilities 1. The IRB is responsible for making a final determination as to whether serious or continuing noncompliance has occurred. 2. The IRB is to receive notification of any instance where the IRB Chair has determined that a potential incident of serious or continuing noncompliance exists. This should occur at the earliest possible time which is usually the next scheduled meeting. 3. The IRB should be advised by the Senior Director of Clinical Research Compliance or the IRB Chair about the actions taken thus far, and determine further actions to be taken. a. All members will be given information known to date of the incident and important supporting documents. b. The IRB, directly or through a delegate, such as the Senior Director of Clinical Research Compliance or a subcommittee formed for the purpose, may request any documents it deems necessary to conduct the investigation. 4. As determined by the specifics of the situation, the IRB reserves the right to conduct any type of investigation deemed necessary in order to obtain the required information. Moreover, the IRB may delegate any component of the investigation to those individuals best suited to perform the functions of the investigation. At any time during the investigation, the IRB may take any one or more of the following actions: a. Suspend or terminate the protocol. b. Designate an individual or a subcommittee to review and investigate the incident and provide information and recommendations for resolution back to the IRB. c. Require additional information. d. Require modifications to the protocol and/or consent form. e. Require that subjects currently or previously on protocol be notified of the non-compliance when such information might relate to their willingness to continue to take part in the research. f. Require that subjects be reconsented. g. Modify the continuing review schedule. h. Require remedial education. i. Require oversight by a senior investigator. j. Monitor the informed consent process. k. Require immediate or periodic audits by the Education and Quality Improvement Program (EQuIP). l. Referring concerns or findings to areas of the organization that administer other policies, laws, and regulations implicated by the non-compliance m. Any other action deemed necessary by the IRB 5. The IRB will be continually updated as information becomes available until final resolution. a. If it determined the incident represents serious or continuing noncompliance the Reportable Events policy will be followed. In the case of noncompliance due to IRB administrative operations, the IRB chair will ensure that all IRB administrative operations staff is recused from IRB members' discussion and/or determinations made about serious or continuing noncompliance. Investigator Responsibilities 1. Investigators are responsible for reporting noncompliance that could potentially be considered serious or continuing in their protocols. 2. Investigators may choose to voluntarily initiate a suspension or termination until the potential issue is investigated and/or resolved. 3. Investigators will also be informed in writing, when allegations of noncompliance are made on their protocols. 4. Investigators are required to fully cooperate with any fact finding and subsequent investigation and maintaining all potentially useful records pending investigation, even if regulations or other policies would otherwise permit destruction of those records. 5. The investigator is responsible for responding promptly in writing, to all issues and questions raised. a. This may include an explanation of the noncompliant event, answers to questions raised by the IRB, and a plan of action to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future. 6. Investigators are responsible for complying fully with all directives of the IRB, whether investigatory or remedial. 7. If the IRB has determined that subjects must be contacted with regards to the noncompliant incident, the investigator will be responsible for doing so if the IRB so directs. 8. For deviations or departures from approved protocols that do not have the potential for being considered serious or continuing noncompliance, investigators are still required to track these events and submit them with the next continuing review. Institutional Official Responsibility The Institutional Official is responsible for submitting a report on behalf of the institution in accordance with the Reportable Event policy. The Final Report For incidents determined to be serious or continuing noncompliance, the Reportable Event policy will be followed. A file of the noncompliant incident, regardless of the ultimate determination, will be maintained in the IRB office.","The IRB reviews in detail the procedures required for the conduct of the research protocol to ensure that the risks are minimized, and the benefits are maximized. The IRB reviews the procedures to ensure they may be conducted safely, and with appropriate oversight and expertise. The IRB also reviews what will happen with the information collected during the study, and whether there are adequate provisions for follow-up if necessary. 1. Is there an adequate rationale for the proposed procedures? 2. Has the investigator provided a complete description of the procedures to be performed, including the associated risks and benefits? 3. Is there a clear differentiation between those procedures that may be required for standard care and those required for research purposes? 4. What will occur with the information the procedures provide? 5. Are there plans to inform research subjects about their specific data, and data from the study results in general? 6. When appropriate, are the procedures and assessment combined with those that are already performed for diagnostic or treatment purposes?","Boston Children's Hospital complies with all applicable local, state, and federal regulations that pertain to reporting requirements. These regulations require that the following be reported: 1. Unanticipated problems that involve risks to participants or others. 2. Suspension or termination of Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval of research 3. Serious or continuing noncompliance with regulations or the requirements of the IRB. The same criteria and process for conducting investigations, making determinations about reporting, and actions taken will apply to all research regardless of funding source. The IRB reserves the right to voluntarily report any event that is not associated with federal funding to the Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP). All reporting actions are to occur within the minimal amount of time necessary to conduct complete and conclusive investigations, with a final report goal of no more than 30-days from the time an event is identified. 1. If it appears that an investigation and resolution of the event may take longer, the Institutional Official (IO) may submit an initial report with any information known to date and the time frame necessary to submit a final report. 2. If federally funded or under the jurisdiction of the FDA, the Institutional Official will submit any report on behalf of the institution. Reporting to regulatory federal agencies is not required if the Principal Investigator (PI) voluntarily closes a study to new subject accrual or temporarily halts the research procedures. In this situation, the IRB, IRB Chair, or administrative officials may recommend voluntary closure of subject recruitment and/or research activities to the PI. However, the PI makes the decision whether closure is appropriate. If the IRB or IRB Chair requires suspension or termination, the incident is reportable under this policy.",4,3,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

What tasks are the helper responsible for during the admission process in the PACU,0,"1. All patients will be admitted by a primary nurse. The nurse is responsible listening to the patient's chest, assessing heart rate, respiratory rate, quality of breath sounds, and for pain assessment. 2. All patients arrive to the PACU receiving supplemental oxygen. The anesthesia provider e.g. anesthesia staff, trainee or CRNA is responsible for placing the patient on the oxygen saturation monitor and transferring the patient to wall oxygen. The accompanying anesthesia provider is responsible for the care of the patient until vital signs are determined to be stable and report has been given to the PACU nurse. 3. The primary nurse is assisted by a helper (second nurse or clinical assistant.) The helper is responsible for obtaining blood pressure and temperature, and placing the patient on the cardiorespiratory monitor. During an admission where a second PACU assistant is not available, the OR team may assist in the admission to expedite the process. 4. The PACU admitting team verbally reports temperature to the anesthesia provider who ensures that this is electronically documented in AIMS record.

Social stories specific to Boston Children's Hospital are accessible via the External Web. ▪ To access: go to the External Web → Centers and Services → Autism Spectrum Center → Resources → My Hospital Stay. There are social stories with pictures for a pre-op visit, labs draws, overnight stays, etc.. Please consult CL for additional resources. ◦ Patients with ASD are often concrete, visual learners. When giving directions, use ""First/Then"" language. ◦ Utilize coping/distraction items (e.g. iPad, chewy toys) whenever available • During chart review, identify patient with ASD and note the following: ◦ Has the patient had a BRT evaluation in the past? If so, is there a current (<1 year old) BRT Behavior Plan in place? ◦ Has the patient been evaluated by Psych for comorbidities? ◦ Has the patient tolerated prior hospitalizations and/or surgical procedures? Was anything particularly challenging? Were any strategies/interventions particularly helpful? • Contact the parent/guardian/caregiver to obtain additional information. Use the following screening questions from CL/BRT as a guide: ◦ How does the patient communicate? ◦ Does the patient have sensory sensitivity to touch, noise, light, too many people, etc.? If so, what helps? ◦ How does the patient react to pain? ◦ What situations trigger/upset the patient? ◦ How does the patient react when upset or agitated? (e.g. kicking, yelling, throwing things, biting, withdrawal, self harm) ◦ How do you calm the patient? (e.g. explanation/information, distraction, quiet space, music, iPad) ◦ Does the patient have an awareness of safety or a history of bolting/fleeing in an attempt to cope? ◦ How does the patient cope with transitions and schedule changes? ◦ What have prior hospitalizations been like for the patient? ◦ Is there anything else we need to know to care for the patient? ◦ Is the parent/caregiver interested in a BRT consult at the pre-op visit? ▪ No: Document if the parent/caregiver denies behavior issues and/or declines a BRT consult. ▪ Yes: Email BRT-DL and the Perioperative Care Coordination Clinic (PCCC) Child Life Specialist (CLS). Document on the PAEF if BRT plans to meet with the family in the PCCC (include pager #) or call the family at home. ◦ If applicable, is the current BRT Behavior Plan still accurate? • Include anesthesiologist Dr. Bistra Vlassakova on emails regarding patients with Behavior Plans • For all patients with ASD and/or documented behavioral issues, notify the PCCC CLS.

What action does the text instruct the reader to take in relation to the attached file,0,"In addition to resolving conflicts of interest, BCH takes steps to monitor for and mitigate commercial bias. These steps include: • The DE promotion of opportunities within the educational setting for learner participation, debate and dialogue allows for discussion of alternatives and continuous improvement. • For activities where individuals have COIs, course directors, or non-conflicted medical reviewers appointed by the course director, monitor their CE activities for commercial bias. For live activities, if commercial bias is perceived by the course director or his/her designee, the monitoring physician shall take appropriate steps to mitigate the identified bias to the extent practicable prior to completion of the activity. • The DE also monitors CE activities to determine if commercial bias is present and to take action to mitigate it if bias is identified. • Learners are asked to identify any perceived commercial bias through the activity evaluation. If 7% or more of participants perceive commercial bias in the activity, the course director will take action to mitigate the bias and safeguard against future bias by taking one or more of the following actions: ◦ Speaking with the faculty member about the bias that was perceived and discussing how to avoid commercial bias in the future ◦ Notifying learners in writing of the identified bias and providing amended content, if appropriate ◦ For revisable enduring materials, revision of the content as needed as part of the activity's annual review process ◦ Not inviting the faculty member to participate in future activities ◦ Requesting assistance from the DE Medical Director regarding appropriate corrective measures","• Deciding between actions: Accept, Acknowledge, Decline, or None? ◦ Accept : stick with this if your research into the order history (via history link) shows that the Medication Request is appropriate! This is the default. (Pro tip: you can also ""right-click"" on an order in the PPM view to see history.) ◦ Acknowledge : use this if you are NOT going to dispense a dose but need to clear the Med Request from the PPM window. Example: general Pyxis refill request where RPh actions take place outside of PharmNet. ◦ Decline : use this if a dispense is already in process or the medication request is otherwise inappropriate. Communicate with RN if there will be a delay or you won't be dispensing a dose (via Connect message or phone call). Leave a brief note for other pharmacists via ""comment"" – this will show up in the ""Med Request View History"" if another RPh has questions about why a request was declined. ◦ None : use this if you want to take no action and also leave the message in the PPM queue. Example: medications not yet verified, more information needed from RN, etc. • If multiple requests are sent for the same order before the request is processed, only one Medication Request will show in the PPM queue. The ""History"" link will display each request. If the RN changes the Med Request priority, the most recent priority will display. • Can I print med requests to facilitate communication to bench team about special requests? No, printing is not an available function. Pharmacy communication forms will be made available on M7. • Working with PharmNet from the PPM: Don't close the PharmNet window in between processing requests. ◦ This slows down performance. ◦ Leaving PharmNet open will keep your ""recent patient list"" in the event you need to research an old request. Closing PharmNet will lose the recent patient list. (Hint: to update your recent patient list in PharmNet, go to Options -> User Preferences -> Patient List) ◦ Please do change the patient / refresh PharmNet when you are finished, so as not to lock the patient's PharmNet profile. • ** Note : when a Med Request is processed from the PPM (via accept, acknowledge, or decline), it is cleared from the queue, regardless of whether you generate a label/dispense a dose. There is a potential to lose Med Requests if a Request is accepted through PPM but not dispensed through PharmNet. Use recent patient task list if back-tracking is necessary. • What if I really need access to a previously processed dose and I don't have the patient on my recent patient task list? A Discern Analytics Med Request report is coming soon. In the meantime, contact the CHAMPS on call pharmacist if it's urgent. A query of recently processed med requests can be run on demand. • What happens if I process & accept a Medication Request that hasn't been verified yet? PharmNet will launch with the ""Verify"" action instead of the ""Label"" action pre-selected. **Caution: if you do not verify the order & dispense a dose, the Med Request will still be cleared from the PPM Med Request queue. Be sure to communicate with RPh covering orders for that floor to let them know RN is looking for a dose! • What changed for nursing? Ability to set a priority, and enhanced history with the ability to see whether we have processed a request. • Forgot what an RN comment said after you printed a dose? (i.e. a tube station number or special instruction?) The comment is viewable through ""View history"" in Pharmnet, either through ""Label -> view history"" or ""History -> Med Req Hx""","1.

Peritoneal dialysis may be performed in the following ways: • Continuous Cycler Peritoneal Dialysis (CCPD) • Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) ◦ CAPD is a means of providing peritoneal dialysis which does not require any machinery. ◦ The patient and caregiver will complete a unit based CAPD competency. ◦ CAPD is taught to the patient/caregiver as a means of emergency backup dialysis in the event that continuous cycler peritoneal dialysis cannot be performed.,"• Keep sterile dressing clean, dry and securely taped in between dressing changes unless there is excess drainage or bleeding. • Change dressings when there is drainage, bleeding or leakage. • Frequent dressing changes during the first 2-3 weeks are not necessary unless dressings become wet, soiled or non-occlusive. • Immobilize the catheter with a dressing and tape to minimize trauma. It is important to minimize catheter movement and handling since local trauma can increase the risk of bacterial colonization with subsequent infection. • To minimize the risk of fluid leak, it is preferable to wait at least 14 days after catheter insertion before beginning peritoneal dialysis treatments. If peritoneal dialysis is required before the recommended 14 days, perform small volume exchanges and dwells only in a recumbent position to minimize the risk of fluid leak whether CCPD or CAPD is being utilized.",4,4,4,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
What is the role of ECMO in the MSICU Clinical Practice Guideline,f,"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is the application of a modified cardiopulmonary bypass circuit designed for extended duration use in patients with cardiac and/or respiratory failure who do not respond to conventional measures or treatments. This guideline broadly describes the application of ECMO to patients with primary cardiac failure, primary respiratory failure, or a combination of both. The clinical management of patients requiring ECMO support is administered by a multidisciplinary team. The technical aspects of ECMO are managed by specially trained Registered Respiratory Therapists (RRTs) referred to as ECMO Specialists. A number of ECMO circuits and systems are available to support patients of all age groups. ECMO is either applied electively or urgently. When instituted in the setting of cardiac arrest, it is referred to as extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation or ECPR. ECMO is primarily initiated in the CICU or the MSICU, but may be initiated in the OR and Cardiac Catheterization Lab, and in rare circumstances, initiation in the Emergency Department, NICU or MICU may be needed for moribund patients who are too unstable to transfer. Avoid ECPR deployment in clinical or diagnostic areas that do not have the appropriately trained personnel, supplies, and infrastructure to initiate ECMO (e.g. Radiology, Emergency Department). Instead, patients who are candidates for ECMO should be rapidly transferred to the CICU or MSICU for treatment.","1.

Instead, patients who are candidates for ECMO should be rapidly transferred to the CICU or MSICU for treatment.","1. ECMO initiated to support cardiopulmonary resuscitation (E-CPR) is best initiated in a location with personnel experienced in the procedure, namely the MSICU or, in the case of an intra-operative arrest, the OR. For other ICU and non-ICU settings it is preferable to transfer patients to the MSICU for ECMO cannulation with ongoing effective CPR rather than attempting to bring all resources for cannulation to an outlying area. 2. The decision to activate E-CPR, as well as the determination of location for cannulation, will be made by the MSICU critical care attending physician in conjunction with the general surgery attending. In the OR, the decision to activate E-CPR can be made by the anesthesiology attending physician in conjunction with a general surgery attending. ◦ For patients already in the MSICU or OR, E-CPR can be activated by calling x5-5555 and requesting ""CODE ECMO, 7 South Bedspace ______, _____kg patient"" or, for the OR, ""CODE ECMO, Main OR 3 rd floor, OR _____, ____kg patient."" i. For locations outside of the MSICU or OR, the request for E-CPR should be communicated directly by an attending physician to the MSICU critical care attending at x5-6428 (back-up pager #6428). He/she will immediately contact the general surgery attending, activate CODE ECMO (if indicated) to the appropriate location (typically the MSICU), and direct the requesting physician to continue high quality CPR while transporting the patient.",• ECMO in the MSICU Clinical Practice Guideline • American Heart Association Advanced Cardiac Life Support and Pediatric Advanced Life Support Guidelines,• Clinical Practice Guideline Revision: Management of Hyperbilirubinemia in the Newborn Infant 35 or More Weeks of Gestation.

The interaction is synergistic; specifically, it is reciprocating and co-constituting. The nurse comes to ""know"" the patient and family and the patient and family comes to ""know"" the nurse. When the relationship is in-sync, that is, when it is synergistic then optimal patient outcomes are more apt to occur. Because we believe that excellence in care is provided through meaningful therapeutic relationships with patients and their families, continuity in care is a core element of our model of care. • In support of fostering therapeutic patient/family-nurse relationships, the Charge and Staff Nurses work together to build continuity in nursing care over the patient's illness trajectory by assigning a limited number of nurses to the patient/family. • As colleagues, more experienced nurses mentor less experienced nurses. • Since the needs of patients vary across the system, we have a varying number of Level I, II, and III Staff Nurses and Advanced Practice Nurses who provide varying levels of expertise on each unit to best accommodate patient needs.","Even when targeting professional or sophisticated audiences, web content that's concise and to the point tends to perform better.
