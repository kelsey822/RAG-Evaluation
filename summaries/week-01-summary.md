# Week 1 Summary
* Decided on a project to focus on - evaluate the pipeline for Large Language Models (LLMs) augmented by Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
* Set up repository for the summer and discussed benchmarks to stay on track
* Got refamiliarized with best practices, python, created virtual environment, and downloaded dependencies.
* Began exploring concepts behind deep learning, LLMs, and RAG.
* Started to attempt building a basic RAG pipeline.
* Set up Children's email/VPN and scheduled laptop encryption appointment
