What is Dexmedetomidine?,"Dexmedetomidine is an alpha-2 agonist that acts centrally as a sedating agent with minimal effect on respiratory status. Similar to clonidine, dexmedetomidine can produce a variety of hemodynamic responses including bradycardia, hypotension and hypertension. Dexmedetomidine is administered by continuous infusion. It is ultra-short acting and the effects (including sedation) will rapidly resolve if the infusion is discontinued. Dexmedetomidine may be used for sedation or anxiolysis in patients without an artificial airway, or as an adjunct to other sedating agents for patients with an artificial airway.","• Dexmedetomidine is used to provide sedation for critically ill patients when traditional agents are not adequate or in an attempt to spare use of benzodiazepines • Dexmedetomidine and clonidine are alpha 2 adrenergic agonist agents. Both display a high specificity for the α receptor over the α receptor; however, Dexmedetomidine exerts a specificity of 1600:1 for α : α 2 1 2 1 receptor, whereas the specificity of clonidine is 200:1. For this reason, there are no direct conversions of Dexmedetomidine to clonidine. There are, however, recommended clonidine doses. Inclusion Criteria: • Need for sedation including short term peri-extubation sedation (consider in place of benzodiazepines when applicable) • Anticipate < 14 days of sedation Not recommended due to minimal data: • < 35 weeks post menstrual age • Potential need for ECMO • Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy requiring therapeutic hypothermia Contraindications • Uncontrolled hypotension • Sustained bradycardia (heart rate < 80) • Hepatic failure","This category includes diseases or clinical states in which the use of dexmedetomidine may be indicated, but only after careful consideration of the risks involved and other viable options: 1.

Symptoms of opiate withdrawal appear to be due to increased noradrenergic neuronal activity in the locus ceruleus which is regulated both by alpha-2 adrenergic and opiate receptors. Clonidine appears to exert specific effects through non-opiate alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. Important points: • Clonidine can NOT be abruptly stopped • Routes of administrations: ◦ Transdermal patch: preferred route; available as 100mCg/ patch. Transdermal clonidine patches MAY BE CUT to achieve a smaller dose in the ICU areas and under certain circumstances on the floor. Nursing staff cut the patch into ¼ or ½ fractions based on dose needed. ◦ Enteral: should be used if patch not adhering due to diaphoresis; or when bridging to patch is indicated ◦ Intravenous: should be used only if enteral or transdermal routes are not an option; or when bridging to patch is indicated and patient is NPO 4 Routinely opioid and benzodiazepine continuous infusions should not be converted to intermittent IV dosing when patient NPO due to increased number of times accessing line.

What is ECMO,"1. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is the application of a modified cardiopulmonary bypass circuit designed for extended duration use in patients with cardiac and/or respiratory failure who do not respond to conventional measures or treatments. 2. This guideline broadly describes the application of ECMO to patients with primary cardiac failure, primary respiratory failure, or a combination of both. 3. The clinical management of patients requiring ECMO support is administered by a multidisciplinary team. The technical aspects of ECMO are managed by specially trained Registered Respiratory Therapists (RRTs) referred to as ECMO Specialists. 4. A number of ECMO circuits and systems are available to support patients of all age groups. ECMO is either applied electively or urgently. When instituted in the setting of cardiac arrest, it is referred to as extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation or ECPR. 5. ECMO is primarily initiated in the CICU or the MSICU, but may be initiated in the OR and Cardiac Catheterization Lab, and in rare circumstances, initiation in the Emergency Department, NICU or MICU may be needed for moribund patients who are too unstable to transfer. 6. Avoid ECPR deployment in clinical or diagnostic areas that do not have the appropriately trained personnel, supplies, and infrastructure to initiate ECMO (e.g. Radiology, Emergency Department). Instead, patients who are candidates for ECMO should be rapidly transferred to the CICU or MSICU for treatment.","Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is the application of a modified cardiopulmonary bypass circuit designed for extended duration use in patients with cardiac and/or respiratory failure who do not respond to conventional measures or treatments.

An Attending Physician in consultation with an Attending Surgeon notifies the Charge RN of the decision to initiate ECMO. 2. The Charge RN notifies the ECMO Specialist by paging E-C-M-O (3266) , and conveying the patient's weight, diagnosis, and location of cannulation. The ECMO Specialist brings the ECMO system and cannula cart. 3. The Charge RN facilitates the notification of a surgical team, and requests an ""ECMO Pack"" from the Blood bank. 4. Refer to unit-specific processes for ECMO notification. Patient Selection General Indications ECMO is considered in the following situations: ◦ Cardiac arrest in which the cause of arrest is unclear and the underlying condition warrants further evaluation. ◦ Low cardiac output syndrome despite maximal hemodynamic support. ◦ Severe sepsis. ◦ Support for high-risk procedures. ◦ Newborns with hypoxemic respiratory failure (e.g. PPHN) with a sustained oxygenation index (OI) ≥ 40 with CMV, or ≥ 60 with maximum treatment including HFOV ± iNO. ◦ Pediatric respiratory failure. ◦ Cardiorespiratory failure of unclear etiology. ◦ Worsening or persistent pulmonary air leaks refractory to air-leak ventilator strategies and other interventions. ◦ Inadequate gas exchange despite optimized HFOV or other advance ventilator modalities and strategies. ◦ Congenital diaphragmatic hernia. ◦ Bridge to lung transplantation. ◦ Bridge to heart transplantation or other form of mechanical circulatory support. ◦ Toxic Ingestion ◦ Hypothermia Relative Contraindications ◦ Weight < 1.5 kg due to cannula size limitations (Except for thoracic cannulations). ◦ Gestational age < 34 weeks due to the increased risk of IVH because of the need for anticoagulation ◦ Existing large intracranial hemorrhage ◦ Fatal chromosomal abnormality ◦ Continuous CPR for 1 hour prior to the availability of ECMO (e.g. unwitnessed out-of-house cardiopulmonary arrest) ◦ Severe coagulopathy, high risk for or active bleeding. Modes of ECMO Support General Description Mode Drainage Re-infusion Veno-arterial (VA) Venous Arterial Veno-venous-arterial (VVA) Venous-Venous Arterial Veno-venous (VV) Venous Venous Veno-venous Venous (VVV) Venous-Venous Venous Venous-venous Dual-lumen (VVDL) Venous Venous-venous Bi-caval Dual-lumen Venous (VV Bi-caval) Venous-Arterial ◦ Venous-arterial (VA) ECMO provides cardiac and pulmonary support. Blood is drained from the right- side of the heart and re-infused into the arterial circulation. ◦ Drainage is established by cannulation of the right atrium, cannulation of a femoral vein, or cannulation of the right internal jugular vein. Re-infusion is established by cannulation of the aortic arch, cannulation of a femoral artery, or cannulation of the right common carotid artery. ◦ Drainage of the left atrium may be enhanced with the addition of an LA-vent (VA+LA-vent) to the drainage limb, which aids in decompressing a failing left ventricle. Decompression of the left atrium may also be accomplished by performing a balloon atrial septostomy. ◦ Some larger patients may require two drainage cannulae such as both femoral veins, or one femoral vein and one internal jugular vein (e.g. VV-A). Venous-Venous ◦ Venous-venous (VV) ECMO provides pulmonary support. Blood is drained from, and re-infused to, the right-side of the heart. ◦ Specially designed double-lumen cannulas (VVDL) provide drainage and re-infusion, and are placed into the right internal jugular vein. ◦ In larger patients venous drainage is usually from a femoral vein and re-infusion through the right internal jugular vein, and in larger patients two femoral venous cannulae may be needed for optimal drainage (VV-V). ◦ VV-B-caval cannulas are used for anticipated long-term ECMO (e.g. bridge to lung transplant), and are inserted with the aid of fluoroscopy, generally in the cardiac catheterization lab or OR. Circuit Preparation and Cannulation Circuit Preparation Elective ECMO ◦ An ECMO Specialist prepares and maintains ECMO circuits. ◦ Circuit preparation consists of a step-wise priming procedure, with the final step being the addition of blood products. Once blood products are added and treated, the crystalloid solution is displaced, and an ECMO circuit panel is measured. ◦ The lab results are designated as a ""Circuit Panel"", indicating the results are from the circuit prior to patient interaction. Circuit Panel Targets pH 7.35 - 7.45 K + < 8 mEq/L PCO 35-45 mmHg Ionized Ca ++ > 0.8 mEq/L 2 PO > 300 mmHg Na + > 125 mEq/L 2 HCO - 22-24 mEq/L 3 ECPR ◦ Two readily deployable circuits are available for ECPR; a neonatal circuit for patients < 8 kg, and a pediatric circuit for patients >8 kg. The circuits are rapidly primed with PlasmaLyte-A, albumin, and heparin. Cannulae Selection Cannulae selection is determined by: ◦ Route: Groin, neck, or chest ◦ Surgical Technique: Cut-down or percutaneous ◦ Type of ECMO support: VV, VVDL, VVV, VVA, or VA ◦ Refer to ECMO Reference Tools . Pre-cannulation Considerations 1. The ICU Attending Physician, Fellow, or Nursing confirms: a. Clot present in blood bank b. Neurologic assessment (HUS for neonates) c. Venous and arterial access d. Plan for sedation and analgesia e. Review of outside ECHO (if available). 5. Nursing obtains: a. CBC b. Clot c. PT, PTT, Fibrinogen d. Electrolytes 6. Position patient for cannulation; infants are best positioned with head at the foot of the bed for neck cannulations. 7. Prepare medications: a. Routine resuscitation medications b. Heparin bolus of 75 units/kg c. Heparin 100 units/mL in D10W or D5W (total 50mL) for continuous infusion d. Hydralazine 0.1 mg/kg/dose IV e. 5% albumin f. Normal saline for fluid resuscitation g. Amicar if indicated h. Sedation and analgesia as ordered by the ICU Fellow or Nurse Practitioner i. Paralytic agent as ordered by the ICU Fellow or Nurse Practitioner Cannulation 1. A surgical team performs the cannulation procedure, and conducts a procedure ""time-out"" prior to incision. Refer to ECMO Time Out . 8. The ICU Team monitors and manages hemodynamics, airway, ventilatory support, and ensures sedation and analgesia during the cannulation procedure. 9. At the direction and discretion of the cannulating surgeon, the patient may receive a bolus of 75 units/kg of heparin prior to placement of cannulae. 10. Once cannulae have been secured, the ECMO circuit drainage and re-infusion lines are passed to the surgeon in a sterile manner and cut away from the ECMO priming reservoir. 11. The drainage, or venous line, is indicated with a blue marker and the re-infusion, or arterial line, with a red marker. Once a second time out is performed, and the surgeon verifies air-free connections, and the ECMO Specialist verifies that the lines are connected properly, the line clamps are removed and the ECMO pump is started. Immediate Post-Cannulation Period Elective ECMO ◦ Target ECMO flow rate of 100 – 200 mL/kg/min. ◦ When possible, quickly wean vasoactive drugs. ◦ If there is decreased venous return, administer volume, assess cannula position, and increase height of the bed. ◦ Assess the degree of recirculation with VVDL ECMO. This can be managed by placing a roll under the patient's shoulders, manipulating ECMO flow rates, or confirming cannula position. ◦ The Surgeon dresses the cannula site and maintains a sterile field until Attending Surgeon, or designee, confirms cannula position by CXR. ◦ Once flow has been established, administer platelets and cryoprecipitate. ◦ The ECMO Specialist monitors membrane and drainage, pressures, flow rate, and sweep gas. ◦ Measure an ABG, electrolytes, and ionized calcium once the patient is stable. ◦ Measure a hematocrit, platelet count, PT, Fibrinogen, AT-III, and unfractionated heparin level once all the blood products are given (approximately 2 hours after cannulation). ECPR ◦ As soon as the blood pack arrives, PRBCs, FFP, platelets, and cryoprecipitate, are administered and hemofiltration established in order to achieve normal fluid balance and hemoconcentration. ◦ Verify cannula placement via a CXR. Echocardiography may also be used to assess cannulae position, volume status of the patient, and the degree of decompression of the RA and LA. Blood Components Blood Products for Cannulation Once the decision has been made to use ECMO, notify the Blood Bank and request an ECMO Blood Pack which consists of PRBC: 2 units, FFP: 1 unit, Cryoprecipitate: 1 unit, and Platelets: 2 units. Blood Product Administration Packed red blood cells (PRBC) ◦ 20 mL/kg for a HCT < 30%, or specific target per ICU team Platelets ◦ Transfuse at least 2 units of platelets for platelet count is < 80,000 µ/L, or specific target per ICU team. Cryoprecipitate ◦ Transfuse at least 2 units for fibrinogen < 100 mg/dL or specific target per ICU team. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) ◦ Administer 10 mL/kg if the PT is ≥ 17 seconds. 5% Albumin ◦ Crystalloid may be used for volume expansion such as acute decrease in venous return. The use of 5% albumin as a volume expander should be reserved for patients with low albumin levels. For more information, please refer to the Patient Care Manual: Transfusion of Blood Products and PCM>ECMO & Mechanical Circulatory Support: Anticoagulation Management Protocol. General ECMO Management Blood Gas Monitoring Obtain: ◦ Pre- and post membrane blood gases when acute and unexpected changes in gas exchange occur and membrane function is in question. ◦ Arterial blood gases following cannulation and repeat until adjustments in flow rate and sweep gas achieve clinically acceptable results. ◦ Routine arterial blood gases a minimum of every 12 hours and every time a change in sweep gas is made. ◦ A mixed venous saturation a minimum of every 24 hours for calibration of the ECMO mixed venous saturation monitor or if there is a question about adequate ECMO flow on VA ECMO. Hemodynamic Monitoring and Blood Pressure Control Neonates ◦ Neonates requiring ECMO support are at significant risk for intracranial hemorrhage due to pre- existing hypoxemia/hypotension, anti-coagulation, venous occlusion, or carotid artery ligation. ◦ Mean arterial pressure is generally maintained at age specific norms (Neonates 45-50 mmHg; Children/Adults 50-70 mmHg), and changes in MAP to > 70 mmHg or < 30 mmHg may require immediate action. ◦ Initial actions include ruling-out any mechanical problems associated with ECMO, such as, inadvertent hemofiltration, or changes in ECMO flow. ◦ Acute and sustained hypotension may be corrected with volume replacement, by increasing vasoactive medications, or by increasing the ECMO flow (if able). ◦ Acute and sustained hypertension may be managed by assessing the need for additional sedation or analgesia, and administering hydralazine at 0.1 mg/kg/dose (usual max 0.5 mg/kg). Pediatric-Adult ◦ A clinically acceptable mean arterial pressure range is established by the care team; ECMO flows and vasoactive agents are titrated accordingly. ◦ Rule out mechanical problems associated with ECMO, such as inadvertent hemofiltration, or changes in ECMO flow, when acute changes in blood pressure occur. ◦ Correct acute and sustained hypotension with volume replacement, by increasing vasoactive medications, or by increasing the ECMO flow (if able). ◦ Manage acute and sustained hypertension by assessing the need for additional sedation or analgesia, administering antihypertensives, or reducing the ECMO flow. Temperature Regulation ◦ Maintain patient temperature per target prescribed by ICU team by making adjustments in the water pump temperature. ◦ Following ECPR, consider decreasing body temperature to 33-35°C for neuro-protection; follow established hypothermia guidelines. Laboratory Studies and Cultures ◦ CBC, platelets, coags, AT-III, and unfractionated heparin level every 6 hours for the first 24 hours. After that, CBC, platelets, and coags are done every 12 hours. However, AT-III and unfractionated heparin level remain at every 6 hours. ◦ The rest of the lab plan is per ICU team. ◦ For more information, refer to PCM>ECMO and Mechanical Circulatory Support: Anticoagulation Management Protocol . Analgesia and Sedation Cannulation ◦ The ICU fellow provides sedation during the cannulation procedure. Choice of agents is patient and situation specific, but generally includes an opioid, a benzodiazepine, and a muscle relaxant. ◦ Doses of fentanyl required to achieve comfort and avoid hypertension during surgical dissection of the neck are higher than those typically used for sedation. Titrated doses up to 25 mcg/kg are reasonable. ECMO Course ◦ Following cannulation in the ICU team will establish a sedation plan. ◦ Use of fentanyl for ongoing analgesia following cannulation is not recommended due to absorption by the ECMO membrane. ◦ The uses of volatile anesthetic agents or lipid based infusions are not recommended with the use of microporous ECMO membranes. Volatile anesthetic agents may be administered through the usual intrapulmonary route. Muscle Relaxants ◦ Consider the use of muscle relaxants when evaluating decannulation readiness, when patient movement interferes with achieving target ECMO flow rates or potentially compromises the security of the cannula sutures ◦ If muscle relaxants are being used, consider daily wake-up tests in order to perform neurologic exams. Antibiotics ◦ The ICU team will prescribe appropriate antibiotic coverage. Neurologic Evaluation ◦ Consult the Neurologic ICU team following cannulation. Neurology provides daily assessments. Neonates ◦ Obtain a head ultrasound within 24 hours following cannulation and every 48 hours thereafter, unless there are abnormal findings, in which case a daily HUS is obtained. ◦ An additional HUS may be warranted for acute and frequent BP instability. Pediatric-Adult ◦ Periodically hold muscle relaxants and, if needed, perform a sedation holiday in order for an exam by a neurologist to be conducted. ◦ The multidisciplinary team collaboratively makes the decision to pursue diagnostic imaging (e.g. portable head CT), weighing risk and benefits of patient. Skin Care Refer to: Pressure Ulcer Risk Assessment and Prevention . ECMO Cannula Site/Dressing Change Neonates ◦ Place a gel pad, or small Z-Flo pillow, under occiput. ◦ Provide appropriate boundaries and prevent hip abduction by ""nesting"" the patient. Initiate bilateral patient rotation. ◦ Keeping the patient's head midline, list side to side, every two hours, to slightly redistribute pressure points. Pediatric-Adult ◦ Some specialty beds do not provide a pressure relieving surface. Meticulous skin care is needed to prevent skin breakdown. List patient side to side Q2 as tolerated. Maintain heels off bed. ◦ Post femoral cannulation: maintain proper body alignment as tolerated with ECMO flow to prevent peripheral neuropathy. ◦ Perform Braden Q score everyday. Once patient is stable, if possible, turn patient side to side once a day to examine back and buttocks for breakdown. ◦ Do not leave CPR boards or other hard objects under patient. ◦ For more information, see the Patient Care Manual: Pressure Ulcer Risk Assessment and Prevention . Nutritional Support ◦ Enteral nutrition can be safely administered during ECMO. Trophic feeds are recommended early during the ECMO course to maintain gut integrity and health. Feeds may then be advanced as per ICU protocol. ◦ Consult with Nutrition Support Service for PN if unable to feed enterally. TPN may be administered via the ECMO circuit. ◦ Lipids are administered directly to the patient via a peripheral IV. Lipids do not exceed > 3 g/kg/day to prevent lipid accumulation and embolism in the circuit. Fluid Management D10W or D20W ◦ Excluding blood products, generally give 80-100 mL/kg/day of volume including PN and intralipids. Diuretics ◦ Immediately after cannulation, most patients require volume expansion due to systemic inflammatory response and capillary leak. ◦ Once the patient's need for fluid resuscitation has improved, and hemodynamics are adequate, diuresis is indicated to improve chest wall and lung compliance. Most patients respond well to loop diuretics (e.g. lasix). Hemofiltration ◦ All ECMO circuits have the ability to be equipped with a hemofilter. ◦ Hemofiltration is typically used to exchange the volume of blood products following a clear prime cannulation. The goal is to be able to remove the amount of fluid that was given in blood products. ◦ Hemofiltration may not be possible if the patient is persistently hypotensive, if there are problems with venous return, or if the patient is hypovolemic. ◦ The ICU Team establishes a daily plan specifying the amount of fluid to be removed by hemofiltration. Examples include: ▪ Volume of blood products only, ▪ Achieving a certain negative fluid balance in a 24-hour period, ▪ A fixed amount each hour, or ▪ No hemofiltration if the patient's native urine output falls below a certain amount. Ventilator Management ◦ When a patient is placed on ECMO due to respiratory failure, the patient should be placed on ""resting vent settings"". The lung protective settings will be determined by the ICU team. ◦ If a patient has air leak, consider eliminating phasic ventilation and using CPAP. ◦ In the CICU, where the lungs are usually healthy, vent settings should be set to achieve normal tidal volumes and preserve FRC. ◦ Artificial airway suctioning is done as clinically needed and per ICU standards. Anticoagulation ◦ Anticoagulation is achieved with a continuous infusion of heparin. Refer to Anticoagulation Management Protocol for more information. Anti-Fibrinolytic Therapy ◦ Consider antifibrinolytic therapy such as aminocaproic acid (Amicar) or tranexamic (TXA) in the management of bleeding. ◦ General indications for Amicar include ▪ Prematurity (e.g. < 37 weeks gestational age) ▪ Following repair of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (x 72 hours) ▪ Post-operative or post-procedure bleeding ▪ Patients with a pre-existing IVH ▪ Severely hypoxic and/or acidotic patients (pH ≤ 7.10 at the time of cannulation) ▪ Patients who receive CPR prior to cannulation ◦ Additional considerations ▪ When using antifibrinolytics for ongoing bleeding, consider an additional loading dose following ECMO circuit changes. ▪ Continue antifibrinolytic therapy throughout the ECMO course for patients with pre-existing IVH. ▪ Antifibrinolytic therapy for postoperative bleeding may be discontinued after 72 hours, if coagulation management is stable and there is no evidence of active bleeding. ▪ Do not infuse antifibrinolytics in the same line as PN. ECMO Circuit Surveillance ◦ ECMO Specialists conduct periodic circuit surveillance and safety checks, and notify the team of potential circuit issues such as thrombus, and when component or circuit replacement is warranted. ◦ ECMO Specialists notify the care team when planned and unplanned troubleshooting sequences are needed. At a minimum the bedside RN, Charge RN, and ICU Fellow are present to monitor the patient during ECMO circuit repairs. ◦ Refer to ECMO System Assessments and Handoffs , Replacing an ECMO Circuit and ECMO Emergencies . Weaning and De-Cannulation Evaluating Readiness for De-cannulation ◦ Recovery of cardiac function. May consider obtaining an ECHO while clamped ◦ Improved lung compliance and resolving alveolar densities on CXR ◦ Cardiovascular stability and adequate renal function ◦ An ICU Fellow is present at the bedside, just prior to, and immediately following separation from ECMO ◦ Closely monitor hemodynamics; titrate vasoactive agents and give volume as needed ◦ Evaluate proper analgesia, sedation, and muscle relaxation ◦ In the MSICU, Refer to Guidelines for Evaluating De-cannulation Readiness in Newborns with CDH and Evaluating De-cannulation Readiness in Newborns with HRF . De-cannulation De-cannulation is a surgical procedure and is coordinated by an Attending Surgeon. An OR team assembles. 12. An ICU Fellow monitors the patient's hemodynamics and ensures anesthesia and analgesia. 13. Maintain the ECMO circuits until surgical drapes are removed and the dressing is placed. 14. The RN prepares sedation, analgesia, muscle relaxants, vasoactive drugs and volume as deemed necessary by the ICU Attending or Fellow.",
